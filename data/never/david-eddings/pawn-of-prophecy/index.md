Highly recommended, by Pornokitsch ("The Belgariad is my go to series whenever I'm sick") among others.

Others mention that the plot is formulaic beyond reason, it's not a good read once you're not a teenager anymore,
there's a ton of misogyny. Was also in jail for child abuse, and honestly, with so many books to read, why bother.
