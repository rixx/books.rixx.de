This is the list of books that I've rated with five stars. Five stars is a special rating for me: Up to four stars I go
by a nebulous combination of quality and enjoyment â€“ it's crude, but at least it's obviously crude and it's a useful
summary.

Five stars is different: I use this rating to convey that a book touched me, that it **changed my life** in some way.
Sometimes it's just that it's a good book that has influenced me significantly. Sometimes it's that I read it in the
right place, at the right time. Sometimes it's that some thought in it will always stay with me, and help me out at
unexpected occasions. And sometimes it's nothing so deep, just that it's a really really good book.

This list is bound to change: Five stars means that I'm fundamentally not over a book, and sometimes, over time, a book
fades from memory and stops being important to me, and will get bumped off the list.
