Mio, my Mio. A book for children, with heart-breaking beauty. The beauty is in how it uses fairytale and lyrical
resonance to spin a story that is both familiar and strange. It meant a lot to me: The unhappy boy who runs away from
home, only to find out that he's the prince of a magical realm â€“ but the realm is in trouble. There is love in every
word. It's *This Is How You Lose The Time War*, only for children.
