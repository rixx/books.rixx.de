Pure wholesomeness: Tomte Tumtetott is a spirit(-ish) who lives on the farm, and only comes out at night. He talks to
the animals (who understand him) and to the sleeping plants and people. He is kind to everybody and has a good word in
every situation. He reminds the sleeping people and animals that spring will come, and is generally very laid back. A
calm book for younger children.
