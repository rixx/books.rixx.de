There's nothing I don't love about this book. It drew me in and swallowed me whole, back in the day. I re-read it so
much that I can still tell you which page I used to skip because it was too scary for me. The illustrations are
gorgeous, the story is rich and true and and wonderful like the best fairytales.

It was only much later that I understood that the beginning was heart-breaking and sad. Funny how there are some books
that are much sadder and more painful for adults than for kids â€“ Coraline is similar.
