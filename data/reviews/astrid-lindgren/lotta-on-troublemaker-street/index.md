Lotta and her siblings are some of Lindgren's most adorable characters. Her teddy (which looks suspiciously like a pig,
but don't tell her!), her siblings, their games, their whole family â€“ it's all lovely without being overly sweet. Lotta
is very real, often angry and finds creative (and not always nice) ways to deal with her anger. And the adults are just
that: adult about it. It's pretty great.
