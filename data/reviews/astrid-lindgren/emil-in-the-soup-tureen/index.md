Adorable book for kids. Emil is wonderful, as is everybody else. As usual, Astrid Lindgren doesn't flinch away from real
life, so Emil is for instance regularly locked away because his parents don't know how to deal with him.

## Fun Fact

Emil is called Michel in German, because [Emil](/erich-kastner/emil-and-the-detectives) was already
taken.
