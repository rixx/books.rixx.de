Michel is delightful and sweet and a prankster and a rascal. He's never malicious, but always in the thick of it. I
liked him a lot, and have always been impressed how much Lindgren can make me feel like I too live on a farm in the
middle of Sweden. It's all so real and true.

## Fun Fact

Emil is called Michel in German, because [Emil](https://books.rixx.de/erich-kastner/emil-and-the-detectives) was already
taken.
