Five years ago we hit rocks. Her hull was breached, and she was shipping water. She rolled on the Great Green like a hog in a swamp. Her speed was gone, and she almost sank. We kept her afloat and made it to port. Then she was repaired. I didn’t judge her as a bad ship. She was damaged in a storm. I judge her by how she sails when her hull is sound.

But fear seeped through gaps in the walls, and now there is nowhere else to hide. Deep down you know this, for the hero I see in you keeps telling you.”
