Did you dream of being the hero of your own adventurous story as a kid? If you did, this will be good for you. Also,
painful.

Probably Still the Chose One is a lovely fantasy short story. Given the choice of reading the Narnia books or
this story, I'd go with the story, which goes on about many of the same things (but then again, I never liked Lewis and
his Christianity-inserts).
