Did you dream of being the hero of your own adventurous story as a kid? If you did, this will be good for you. Also, painful. [Probably Still the Chose One](<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/probably-still-chosen-one/" rel="nofollow">https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fi...</a>) is a lovely fantasy short story. Given the choice of reading the Narnia books or this story, I'd go with the story, which goes on about many of the same things (but then again, I never liked Lewis and his Christianity-inserts).
