Canticle by R.A. Salvatore is just D&D style fantasy. As you'd expect from the early 90s (no offense, present company
excluded): It's pretty generic, with flat characters, badass fights, and a very good vs evil outlook on life.

It is not, however a Canticle for Leibowitz, no matter what the epub metadata claimed. I was so very confused.
