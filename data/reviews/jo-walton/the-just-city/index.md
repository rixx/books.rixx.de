  tldr: Plato fanfic gently mocking the Republic for being unrealistic. Ironically
    felt very cerebral, nearly clinical, and I wanted to like it more than I actually
    liked it.

A very cerebral, nearly clinical book, and I wanted to like it more than I actually liked it. I'm very here for the character of Socrates, and â€¦ not much else, to be quite honest. It's a fun concept, but I felt that even where it tried to go past the clinical, detached nature, it remained off. High quality, but not for me.
