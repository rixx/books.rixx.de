The one and only classic pirate adventure. Much better than I would have thought, given that famous and classic stories
often were good at the time and then remained unreasonably popular. But no, Treasure Island got to me. To be fair, I was
a eleven year old boy, so it was written for me with little way to fail, but still: I couldn't put this book down.
