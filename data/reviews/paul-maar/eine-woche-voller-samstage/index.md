This is the first part of a very German series of books for children. The Sams (from "Samstag", "Saturday") appears the
the very dull, very anxious office worker Herr Taschenbier after for a full week every day fulfills its literal name,
making the book basically untranslatable. The Sams has blue dots all over its face, and whenever you make a wish, a dot
disappears and the wish comes true.

It's a hilarious premise for kids, especially since the adult is a scared bullied slip of a man, and the Sams is
extremely alive and cares about nothing. It's not a girl and not a boy, not human nor animal, it's just itself. We read
the book in school, and I liked it a lot both before and after that. It's got a wild chaotic energy that kids tend to
love – and the only hidden moral lesson is "be yourself and fuck the bullies", which seems like a good thing to teach
kids.
