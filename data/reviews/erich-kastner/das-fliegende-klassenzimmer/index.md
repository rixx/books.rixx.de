    if you put in a lot of work". Which is true, but not the same.

It's the one German boarding school novel and I loved it to pieces as a kid. As all Kästner books except for
[Lottchen](/erich-kastner/das-doppelte-lottchen) it features a fairly transparent self-insert, but it's fine, imo. Most
boarding school novels do this, to be honest.

What I appreciate most, I think, is how real it feels. The kids have worries and problems, and they are vital and real
and are never minimised. No matter if one of the boys feels scared and neglected or if one has not enough money to go
home for Christmas: they have existential feelings and the book does not shy away from them. There are good teachers and
stern teachers, older bullies, younger bullies, protectors in unlikely places, artsy students, and above all:
friendship.

There are a couple of passages in this book that touched my life, repeatedly, when they showed adults behaving with
responsibility and kindness when I felt that I had nobody who I could count on to do the same for me. I first read this
book when I was nine, and then read it many more times until I was ~13. I'm hardly objective here, but it feels like
home and I love it.
