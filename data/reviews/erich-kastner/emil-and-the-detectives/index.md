Charming adventures in Berlin of the 1920s? Children taking on adults together? Wild chases and solidarity? All this,
and more. Emil is infinitely relatable as he travels to the big city, is robbed and tries to recover the money. Emil is
just a good kid in a bad situation, and seeing him grow and manage to muddle through and make friends is heart-warming.

## Fun Fact

This book is the reason why Astrid Lindgren's [Emil](/astrid-Lindgren/emil-in-the-soup-tureen) is called Michel in
German. Can't have two Emils, apparently!
