Konrad goes into a magic wardrobe and comes out in a very weird world. Everything in this book is designed to be fun to
children **and** optionally offend adults at the time. For example the rich suburban villa district where deceased
generals play with tin soldiers. The roller-skating circus horse made redundant by automation. A school where difficult
parents get educated and punished. A futuristic city where a completely automated slaughterhouse suddenly starts working
in reverse and begins sucking in finished handbags and spitting out calves.

Interestingly, Kästner's future predictions sound pretty good ninety years later: Moving sidewalks and pocket telephones
with voice dialling, anybody?
