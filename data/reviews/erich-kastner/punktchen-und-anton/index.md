Goddamnit, this book might have been good. Instead it is infuriating – Kästner inserts sermons (in italics, at least, to
make them easier to skip) into an already heavily moralising story, and tells children about social injustice, money and
the revolution. Other than that, it's a decent story about a rich girl and a poor boy, their friendship, their worries
and woes and joy.

Read any other Kästner instead.
