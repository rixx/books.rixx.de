Do you like some heavy-handed xenophobia morals in your scifi?  The Kite Maker is a short story playing on Earth, 15
years after a peaceful alien race arrived. The Dragonflies, as they were called, were greeted with violence, and now
that they are somewhat integrated into society, the right mob moves against them. Heavy-handed metaphore is mixed with
good characterization, leading to an intentionally painful, okay-but-not-quite-good short story.
