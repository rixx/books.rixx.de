I liked **Flowers for Algernon** by *Daniel Keyes* – even though the ending in itself felt predictable, it was very
clear that the journey to that ending was the core of the book. It's not an easy question: How much does intelligence
determine who we are, and what would happen if our intelligence were to rapidly in- or decrease? While I liked the
concept of the book, I can't say that I enjoyed it though … it felt too stressfull with a hint of the kafkaesque for
that.
