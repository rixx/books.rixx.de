The Last Sun was somewhat generic urban Fantasy, set in a modern Atlantis â€“ that is, if generic urban Fantasy was
usually queer. I appreciated the queer cast, and the worldbuilding, and the hints at larger, deeper things. But since
hints was all we got, I think I'll jot this down as a very pleasant reading experience, but not something I need to
follow up on.
