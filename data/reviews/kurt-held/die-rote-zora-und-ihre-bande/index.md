Zora is wild and cannot be tamed. Together with her friends, they live on the streets (and in their own hidden secret
castle) of Croatia. They steal to survive and have all sorts of adventures with friends, against the autorities, helping
some people, hindering others. It even has a truly positive ending, even if it's forced.
