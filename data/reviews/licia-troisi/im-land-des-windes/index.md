  tldr: Well-done if slightly generic Fantasy story. The last living half-elf, a young
    girl, grows up into a dragon rider and has to grow past her hate and stubbornness
    blah blah blah.

Worldbuilding! I forgot about the worldbuilding of this book. For example, there are tower cities where everything is
organised by the tower layers.

Downsides: Single strong girl syndrome.

It comes down to: Stubborn girl masters dragons. That's it. I loved it.
