  tldr: Sansukh spin-off, "what if you could go back in time to fix things" variation.
    Not as good as the original, but still enjoyable.

Sansukh-variation, with travelling back to the past to fix things. Not as well-written as Sansukh, but then again, what
is? Decent and entertaining, but might have done more with the added knowledge â€“ "some moments in time are fixed" is
such a cope.
