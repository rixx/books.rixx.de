Published five whole years before Stoker's Dracula, this is the story of a creepy castle in the Carpathians, where
unexplained lights and other unnatural occurrences terrify the surrounding villages. It's unusual for Verne, in that
it's barely sci-fi (<span class="spoiler">or at least, the sci-fi enters very late and is nearly invisible for most of
the book, getting pushed to the sidelines by the atmosphere</span>). But his flair for proper research shows and is
admirable as always â€“ Stoker didn't come nearly as close to vivid and correct images of Transsylvania.

This is the Jules Verne book I liked least. I didn't get it, and I didn't care to get it (I had strong opinions on books
when I was nine). It might actually be the first horror-adjacent book that I have read, and might also account for my
dislike of Kafka.
