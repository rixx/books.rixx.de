Chrestomanci was my first encounter with the phenomenon that is Diana Wynne Jones. I liked the books â€“ they seemed to
strike the tricky balance between whimsy, absurdity, and having an actual plot. I can still remember how Christopher
starts going into other worlds, touching things to make them solid. It's a great image.
