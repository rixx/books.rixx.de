Romeo and Juliet: magic edition! Feuding Italian families, throwing magic at each other and being delightfully
temperamental. Add in nosy kids, moody teenagers, snarky cats and almighty matriarchs â€¦ yes, I really like this book.
It's among my top books by Diana Wynne Jones, and that's saying something.
