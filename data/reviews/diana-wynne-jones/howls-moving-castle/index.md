This book confused me a lot when I first read it (to be fair: it is a confusing book). Then I watched the movie a year
or two later, and I didn't connect it with the book *at all*. It only came to me slowly over the course of months that
the two might be connected. It's so weird!

The book is awesome, the movie is awesome, but they are wildly different things. The movie is more beautiful, the book
is more quirky and charming. Alternatively, what [David says](https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1246896457082441730).
