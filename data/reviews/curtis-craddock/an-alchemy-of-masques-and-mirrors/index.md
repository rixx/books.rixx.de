  tldr: Dumas meets Dune in a steampunk world. You'll know if that's for you (it wasn't
    for me).

Faux-Bourbon France fantasy in a world where a weird magical faux-Christian religion has the nobility consist of mostly
vampires (France), mostly teleporting mirror walkers (Spain) and various other descendents of "Apostles". It's all very
swashbuckling.

The protagonist is a shunned hyper intelligent young noblewoman, whose birth deformity means the superstitious society
thinks she's evil. But then she's surprisingly chosen as bride for the crown prince of faux Spain, and everything
escalates very quickly. Good thing she has her trusty musketeer (yes, I know).

Anyhow, it's Dumas-meets-Dune, which was an okay comfort read, but really very unconvincing.
