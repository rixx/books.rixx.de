Popcorn read: Victorian encounters with the paranormal continue, but this time it's in the US. A timid philologist from
a wealthy family (have to do without nobility in the US, after all) meets a Dresden-style magician for hire. They need
to solve a mystery that has its solution foreshadowed so strongly, I nearly couldn't see the text under all the shadow.

Everything about the book was aggravating: the pandering, the protagonist with his extremely exaggerated timidity and
uselessness, the evil evil antagonists, â€¦ I have found the point where the popcorn reads become unenjoyable even for me.
