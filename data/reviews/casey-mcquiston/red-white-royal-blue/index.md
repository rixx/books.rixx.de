Red, White &amp; Royal Blue by *Casey McQuiston* is a rom-com, pure and simple. It's light-hearted, it's witty, it
doesn't feel like "Hello, fellow kids" – what more do you want?

Teenage drama, heartbreak, obtuse protagonists, this book has everything. The son of the (female) President of the US
hates his nemesis, a highly placed Prince of UK royalty. Only, since this is a rom-com – you know what happens with a
nemesis pairing, it's inevitable. We get good political commentary in there, though, discussing consequences of what
would happen with a President with a gay son, and the different ways of navigating these problems – breaking up, hiding,
out'n'proud, etc. Coming from Senlin Ascends, this was exactly the book I needed. An enjoyable read if this genre is an
option for you!
