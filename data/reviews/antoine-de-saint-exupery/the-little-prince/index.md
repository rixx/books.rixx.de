  text: In most ways the strict opposite of this book. Where the Little Prince is
    whimsical and caring, Animal Farm is harsh and brutal. And yet, both want nothing
    more than convince a child-like audience of their point.

The adorable faux-philosophical book with delightfully whimsical moments was something I enjoyed a lot as a kid. I would
imagine that much of its charm is due to my age when reading it though, and if I had read it for the first time now, I
wouldn't be nearly as enchanted by the rose and the sheep and so on.
