I wasn't aware how tightly this story was coupled with the surrounding universe: Children of Thorns, Children of Water
sadly doesn't make much sense if you aren't familiar with *Aliette de Bodard*'s **Dominion of the Fallen** series, and
comes off hurried and confused (but with potential in the worldbuilding!)
