The Tea Master and the Detective by *Aliette de Bodard* is a nie short scifi novella in a world where different sorts of
teas can have a profound impact on how the human brain works, there is deep space that behaves entirely different from
normal space, and we have sentient ships.

I can't really give you an objective review (even less than usually, I mean) because I'm a sucker for sentient space
ships. These ones are very well done, I felt, and the duo of the Tea Master and the Detective worked very well. And if
it is just Sherlock Holmes coupled with an Ann Leckie world â€“ so what? I would've read and enjoyed a full novel of
this instead of just a novella (though it was very well-paced).
