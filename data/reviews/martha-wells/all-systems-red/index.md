I feel a bit like it's hard to judge **All Systems Red** on account of it being so short – it's fast-paced and engaging though, and I felt at least a bit invested in the story. But after reading it, I was more interested in reading the next part and finding out more about the world and the protagonist – the whole book felt a bit like it just provided a backdrop for the further series. As the series is generally well-liked though, I trust that things will pick up from here.
