First time's an ~~accident~~ unfortunate event, second time's establishing a theme: Adults are either criminally
incompetent or evil, good adults die, everything is terrible, but you get to expand your vocabulary. Somebody warn
readers that things are only going to go downhill from here â€“ oh wait.
