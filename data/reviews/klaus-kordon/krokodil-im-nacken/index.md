Literary introduction to the horrors of the GDR and the Stasi. I don't remember the book well enough to say anything
about its accuracy. Kordon usually tells well-researched stories that support the current narrative about past events,
so that's what I'd expect. It's uncharacteristically long, and I don't remember much to justify the length.
