Concluding the series, we get to see the daughter of the first book's protagonist live through 1945 and deal with
everything the world throws at her. Among other things: lies her grandparents told everybody to keep her away from nazi
youth organisations, her father returning from the KZ, her whole worldview toppling along with her country, practical
post-war problems, and adolescence.
