Luckily you cannot read this book in earnest anymore â€“ times have changed too much. So if you read of the far-too-wild,
far-too-stubborn young Ilse, who has to go to a boarding school to learn manners, and who is slowly "tamed" by her new
friends and teachers until she turns into a young lady, you can feel amused or offended (depending on your temperament)
instead of feeling pressured to do the same.
