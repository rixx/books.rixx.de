Early science-fiction? You may not agree, but there's an automaton that drives the protagonist insane (more or less,
shush!), so I'm declaring it sci-fi, on the horror side of things.

In itself, the book sets the Enlightenment and Romantic movements against each other, much like *Frankenstein*
(published a couple of years later). Additionally, it is an early example of psychological horror stories, and
experiments with disjointed narratives to mirror the terror (or insanity, depending on your interpretation) of the
protagonist.
