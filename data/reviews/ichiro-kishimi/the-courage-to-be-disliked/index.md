  text: Existential Kink agrees with most premises in this book, but puts an entirely
    positive spin of shameless enjoyment on them. A good book to balance the dour
    stuffiness of this one.

  tldr: Excellent content semi-obscured behind impressive degrees of obnoxious writing.
    Punchable, yet useful. One of the most important books to me this year.

I strongly disliked many parts of this book. The writing is obnoxious, self-righteous, pseudo-Socratic without ever coming close. I fundamentally disagree with a lot of its premises, and it's in many ways /r/wowthanksimhealed material. This book is very punchable.

At the same time it has been extremely useful to me, in an immediate and actionable way, and I'm very glad I've read it. Books that changed my life get five stars on here, and it undeniably did that.

I only found this thread on Twitter afterwards, and it contains pretty much all of the book without the obnoxiousness: <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1037715339314847747" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1...</a>
