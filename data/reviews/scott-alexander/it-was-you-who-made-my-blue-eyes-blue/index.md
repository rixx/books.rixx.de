Speak about writing to a narrow target demographic: This is a rationalist short story by Scott Alexander, exploring the
impact of logic and colonialisation on an island tribe. KIDDING! While technically correct, it is also false, and I
can't tell you more than that without giving away the best part of the punch line. Go read it! It's not long, and a lot
of fun, particularly the first half, before the smug rationalist author breaks through.
