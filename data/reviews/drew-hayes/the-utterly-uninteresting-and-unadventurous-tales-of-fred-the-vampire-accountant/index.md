Saying that the title has better writing than the rest of the book would be cruel and not quite true (but.) â€¦ I had
hoped for better. This is basically a short story collection, taped together, which is always tricky because while your
short story readers will want a basic recap of who's who and who did what, I really don't want that every 20 pages  in a
book.

A single short story with Fred could've worked pretty well! Things like caring more about environmental impact (you have
to live with the planet you create) and long-term investments? Sure, cool! The anti-discrimination laws and other
hidden-but-official laws? A staple at this point, but an enjoyable one!

But as things are, everything started to grate really soon: The constant emphasis on how passive and normal and kinda
cowardly Fred is, how extremely out of his league his girlfriend is, and I hope you haven't forgotten he's a nerd coward
yet! Ehh.
