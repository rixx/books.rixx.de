  tldr: Fairytale-style romance, very English. I enjoyed the (queer) characters and
    the writing, even though the standard hurt/comfort arc was a little low on substance.

Good forest fairytale. Heavier on the "hurt" side of hurt/comfort that I initially thought. Good characters, good
writing, and only a bit low on substance.
