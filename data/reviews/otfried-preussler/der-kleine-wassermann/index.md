A nice little book for children. Nothing special per se, but I think the way life under water is portrayed is very well
done. The smallest common issues are considered – where is the young waterman allowed to swim? Where's home? How does he
have to dress and what are his chores? This attention to reality and detail is what I still love when reding
sci-fi.
