The second part of the Hotzenplotz series is nice and fun, and not worse than the [first
part](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/1999/der-rauber-hotzenplotz/). But somehow the fact that there is a second part
makes it more common, less exciting. I remember listening to this audio book a lot, and I like that it again emphasises
being clever and tricking the opponent.
