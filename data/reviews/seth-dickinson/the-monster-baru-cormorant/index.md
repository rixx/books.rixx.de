I really liked **The Monster Baru Cormorant** by *Seth Dickinson*. It was provided to me as a review copy by the publisher. Some parts were weaker than the first part of the series, which was rich due to its time skips and introduction into the world, but other parts were just as good and better â€“ we see Baru through other eyes, and even when people misjudge her, it's quite telling. Baru remains a very flawed, sometimes horrible, but always compelling protagonist. I mean, she explains how people are like hash functions, in a non-computerised fantasy world, of course I'd like her. Regrettably, the ending is quite open and we'll all have to wait for the last volume to come in. Drat.
