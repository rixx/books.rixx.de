Oathbringer shows how intensely *Brandon Sanderson* can deliver payoff to &gt;1k pages long story archs. There are
several moments where I was so invested in both the characters an the story, that the ongoing action made me emotional –
we get to see our share of drug problems, depression, psychic breakdowns, all from characters that have a lot of history
and have come a far way. Finally getting all the backstory on Dalinar, and seeing his development, were definitely worth
the read – but I really wish that this Brandon could make this payoff possible in thinner books.
The Stormlight Archives do tend to be … lengthy. And despite the length, somehow we never get to see how the main cast
react to drastic events and revelations. It's weird – but it's still good (sometimes: great) fantasy.
