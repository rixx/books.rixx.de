Wow. It's not only the soulstamp concept that drew me in, it's the mechanics of plausibly altering the past, and the
basic assumption that everything has a soul, an understanding of self, and a dream. Love it. At the same time, it's very
much a one-gimmick story, so if you can't get into the gimmick, you won't like it â€“ but at under 200 pages, you also
won't have lost much time. I'd recommend giving it a shot.
