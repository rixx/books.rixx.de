A short book by Pieper, which I read mostly because it was *there* (and I like Pieper). Not as impressive as some of his
work, it struck me more like one of the notebook blogs – a bit unfinished, a bit WIP, scoring points against other
philosophers and theologists who I don't know or care about. Not worth the read unless you're actively interested in
a Christian take on virtues.

### Notes

Moral philosophy and ethics tend to turn into rules and musings about human behaviour, when at heart they need to be
about human nature („das Sein des Menschen“). The core of Christian moral philosophy is asking the Christian to be like
Christ. But of course this invites all sorts of blasphemy, which we avert by quoting the IV Lateran Council and then
practicing our exegesis and making up (well, cribbing from Thomas) the seven virtues – three theological ones and four
cardinal ones: Faith/Hope/Charity + Prudence/Justice/Temperance/Courage.¹

**Prudence** is the first and foundational among the cardinal virtues; it means to make your will/desire respond to
facts and reality, instead of following your desire heedless of facts. You cannot be good, says Josef says Thomas etc,
unless you know reality. Doesn't need to be intellectual knowledge (but he doesn't really buy that part, which I find
extremely disappointing). *Every sin is in conflict with prudence.* This means education is very important. It also
means your rules are always grounded in reality – you have to see what's really there first, then figure out the
consequences. Think Tiffany Aching's First Sight.

**Justice** means to live truly and honestly with our neighbours. Where prudence is our foundational condition for being
good, justice is our primary and best way of being good. (He rails a bit against *Sittlichkeit*, bougie ethicality
here.) Justice is interesting in that it is a communal work: sure, we need to be just on our own, but the real challenge
is building structures and communities that are just – both between members, and between members and the group. Digs
against individualists who don't accord the group an important role in its own right. More digs against people equating
group justice with state justice, but without a constructive attempt at the topic, sadly.

**Courage** is obviously required for justice (and arguably for prudence, says I). Courage is only possible with
justice, says Pieper, then wastes precious paragraphs on justifying that stance. More interestingly, he talks about
fear, and how especially after the war, people played at being unafraid. He calls out the New Stoics (eg Jünger) as
having nightmares and just burying their fear (which is, he says, very justified in this world we live in). His
fix is to have even more fear of god (and sin, and particularly severing the connection to god), which
is the precondition for real courage. All this is very off-the-rails imo and not a good take on courage at all.

**Temperance**: Humans have lost their natural inner equilibrium, because original sin. (Yes, yes.) Our senses rebel
against our spirit, and that's where the last virtue kicks in. Temperance is the technically most private virtue (it's
about sex and food and general enjoyment, after all), but has been made into a defining part of Christianity as a
response to liberalism. But traditionally, it's the last and least of the virtues, because focusing on it too much leads
to a dead and rule-based morality and a devaluation of sensuality. (This is where you notice that Pieper is
Jesuit-adjacent, but no Jesuit himself). He's very much in favour of sensuality – and quotes his Thomas, who recommends
as cures for depressed moods: enjoyment, crying, sympathy from your friends, focusing on truth/prudence, or … sleeping
and bathing. So yeah, no ascetic dour morality here.

Of course, the four cardinal virtues only work with the three theological ones, blah blah. This is what sets Christians
apart, because their worldly (cardinal) virtues are grounded in supernatural ones. Christian prudence can
contradict obvious worldly wisdom (same for courage), because you can always pull the God card.
