Inversions by *Iain Banks* is a non-Culture Culture novel â€“ unexpected and refreshing. The story is told in Banks' usual
masterful style, and all of pacing, characters, depth, and content are without significant annoyances. I think this is
as much Fantasy as Banks will ever get, and I enjoyed the never-quite-touching storylines, and the connections you
really had to look out for (and that were never explicitly explained). The fact that I knew that this was a Culture
novel added another fun layer, too, because I was constantly considering who was part of the Culture and what their
goals were.

The story grows darker towards the end, and while Banks always writes with unprotected people and minorities in mind, I
was a bit speechless at how well he first portrayed two cultures filled with class entitlement and elitism, and then
contrasted them with torture and a horrifyingly vivid recollection of rape, involving a discussion about the
responsibility and reactions of men as a whole. Wow.
