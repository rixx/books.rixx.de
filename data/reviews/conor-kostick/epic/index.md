The world's a game, and we're all players – that's how things work in *Epic*. Digital currency can be spent and gained
in the global VR video game. Our protagonist is rather poor, and has to play the odds – then he makes the stupid and
desperate move to go all in on CHA. I liked the book a lot, and especially considering it's from 2004, it's held up
incredibly well. Nice storytelling, too!
