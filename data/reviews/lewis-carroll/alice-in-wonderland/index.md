The trippy book. I read Alice as a child, with a lot of confusion at first, and then with some resignation to the fact
that it would all make sense once I was older.

Well, about that.

But despite being confused about Alice, I also was fascinated and interested. I could tell that there was an internal
sense-making at work, a structure that I couldn't see or understand, but that I knew was there regardless. It made my
head hurt in good ways.

Also, the some figures in it are so vivid and weird that I never forgot them. Most of all the cat, whose grin is capable
of staying behind after the cat has vanished. Thinking about this also made my head hurt in a good way.
