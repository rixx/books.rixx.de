Wow, **Nemesis Games** was way better than the previous volume of the **Expanse** series. I enjoyed it tremendously. As
a change of pace, we follow four people on their separate ways (although their stories are connected, of course), and
learn more about each of them. Where at first this seems to be a calmer book to allow for more characterisation, things
take off towards the middle of the book, and then they just don't stop accelerating. I'm really looking forward to how
both the world and the main cast will continue after this.
