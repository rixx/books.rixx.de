This is a short story in the [Expanse](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/by-series/#The%20Expanse) universe, with a
backstory on Fred Johnson. It's not bad, but I had very high hopes â€“ I loved Fred's character and wanted to see more,
look deeper. I didn't feel that the Novella reached the depth I would have liked, even though it was solid throughout,
and the interactions had the Expanse-y style of solid reality that I like so much about the series.
