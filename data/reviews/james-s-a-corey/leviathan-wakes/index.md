Fantastic space opera, even more fun than the TV series. 4.5 stars for me, but I'm rounding up 'cause I'm feeling
generous today and it was just so much immersive fun!

I think what I liked best is that this book is *grimy*. It doesn't hide the underpinnings. It shows you actual
(fucked-up) humans in their actual (fucked-up, of course) society. It's slightly noir, but not in an artsy way. It's
an action-focused book that *still* manages to touch on politics in a decent way, and obviously sets up to do more of
that in the future. Hell yes.

Also, protagonists disagree about which action is the right one and the narrative is on both sides, which may be what
pushed me over the edge into loving this book.
