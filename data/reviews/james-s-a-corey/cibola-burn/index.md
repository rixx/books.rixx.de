Excellent scifi. **Cibola Burn** is the fourth part of **The Expanse**, and the series just keeps on giving. Every book
is exactly what I want to read â€“ difficult situations, new worlds, people who are consistent and neither
good nor evil (except for Naomi, of course), but just live their lives. Cibola Burn felt very much like I'd fear the
exploration of thousands of suddenly appearing new worlds would go. I think if you think too hard about the technology
level displayed in the series, some missing (AI, among other things) tech doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but I'm
willing to forgive this for the vast, technologically and psycologically sound universe.
