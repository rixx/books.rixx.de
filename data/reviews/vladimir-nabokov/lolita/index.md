Lolita was an interesting book to read when I was 18: I was used to reading classics with a critical distance, and
Lolita never fit either my analytic access nor my "god this is really good" access. It's a tough read, but it's always
skillful, never cheap (though often blatant). I think I'm better for having read it, but I can't say why.
