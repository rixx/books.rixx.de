Single biggest source of (faux-)intellectual quotes in the German language. As most people, I enjoyed part one and was
baffled by part two. As most people, I expect this will change over the years.

Related books are mostly books that quote Faust heavily, I'm afraid, since there's not much else to be done with it.
