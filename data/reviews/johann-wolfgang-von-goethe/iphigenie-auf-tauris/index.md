Read because the title sounded so intriguing. The plot requires you to understand some of the most convoluted absurd
Greek family soap drama first. Iphigenie starts out as bored and frustrated, which felt very relatable. The rest is more
of "people talk about people and hilariously don't know who they are", ad infinitum. Plus a lot of hamletian waffling
between duty and inclination â€“ ugh, really.
