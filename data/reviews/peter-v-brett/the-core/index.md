The Core concludes the **Demon Cycle** series by *Peter Brett*, and it was a disappointment to me. While we still get a
couple of cool side characters, the main cast has grown unrelatable to me. The story often felt like a mix of fanfiction
and a detailed narration of a video game: hack, slash, get your dreams, feel mandatory doubt and off you go to
your heroic journey, filled with never-too-difficult enemies. The bit of relevant character development itself (Renna,
mostly) seemed to have taken place between books.

Also, we get a whole new generation of kids, just for the sake of it, it seems. They take up an inordinate amount of
pages (pregnancy, birth, carrying them around) for no contribution, really. I hope they're not meant to be the tie-in
for a sequel series. They felt as cringe-y as the Harry Potter kids, down to the names.

In conclusion: I really liked the first book in the series, and the following books felt middling-to-good. This one
didn't even reach this level. A good part of that may be that my patience with the vastly annoying and stereotyped
Krasians (a vaguely muslimic hurr-durr warrior culture) never paid off, but I'll spare you the rant about that.
