Disappointing, but not surprising: I knew that Dumas had written a lot, and even his best works need a lot of
compression to be readable. The count of Sainte-Hermine probably would not have been good even with much more work,
though. With a *blatant* Mary Sue (much, much worse than Monte Cristo) and a meandering plot at best, finishing this
book is an achievement that was not worth it. Trust me.
