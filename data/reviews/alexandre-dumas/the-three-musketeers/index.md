People underestimate how honestly useful Dumas is. Well, if you get the abridged versions, of course, nobody wants to
read that optimized-for-line-count nonsense. Read up on it, his tricks to stretch dialogue into more lines are
hilarious, to the point of his writing style changing (and characters with long names suddenly dying) when his
publishers changed the rules.

The Musketeers (four, by the way, I counted) are a lot of fun, and worth revisiting if you just want some old-school
adventuring, with Good Guys, Bad Guys, Evil Women etc etc. It also teaches you a surprising amount of history – I'm not
sure when I would have learned of Richelieu, but certainly much later and less memorably.
