Revenge â€“ exciting revenge from nearly beyond the grave! I loved this book to pieces when I discovered it, despite being
confused by it a lot. I was nine at the time, and many concepts in there confused me. How did cheques work? What on
earth was a rentier? (They were spelt the same in German, and the word has fallen completely out of use, because Rentier
also means reindeer. You can understand my confusion.) And I didn't get the whole Bonaparte arc until I re-read it years
later.

But all those things didn't keep me from just thoroughly enjoying the drama.
