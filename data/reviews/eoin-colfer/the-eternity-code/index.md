Artemis gets more growth and a mind wipe, both completely deserved. Holly gets less growth and more voice, which is also
nice. All in all an enjoyable book, up to the standard set by Arctic Incident, and better than the first book.

Plus, this is where Juliet starts to shine, which gives the series some life. And by life, I mean snark.
