This book was honestly, truly, terrible. I picked it up because as a history nerd, "where did this family end up" is
always an interesting prompt. I had not thought that a single book could contain this amount of disjointed anecdotes,
self-important injections, and – most damningly – humble and meek servility towards a dead monarchy. If I have to read
books by monarchists, I'd prefer them to be stylish and clever instead of sleazy and obnoxious.
