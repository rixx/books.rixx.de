I really liked this book â€¦ at first - it hit all the sweet spots for me. Flowery language, not-too-overbearing fantasy
setting, believable characters, good pacing and narration (and training in the $arts).

Kvothe is a terrible Mary Sue even when he's making mistakes. Though of course that's easy to hit, when you write an
author stand-in as protagonist.  At the same time, this is very much a male nerd power fantasy. I still enjoyed the book
a lot, but if that's not a lens or genre you like reading, this probably won't be fun for you.

The four stars are mostly because I enjoyed the worldbuilding and much of the writing.
