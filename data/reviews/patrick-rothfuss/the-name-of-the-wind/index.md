I really liked this book - it hits all the sweet spots for me. Brilliant language, not-too-overbearing fantasy setting, believable characters, good pacing and narration (and a bit of training in the $arts).

Kvothe is relatable even when he's making mistakes, which is really important in protagonists. Though of course that's
easy to hit, when you write a Mary Sue author stand-in as protagonist.
At the same time, this is very much a male nerd power fantasy. I still enjoyed the book a lot, but if that's not a lens
or genre you like reading, this probably won't be fun for you.

Can't wait to read the second part.
