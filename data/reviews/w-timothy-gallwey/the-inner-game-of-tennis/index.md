I hadn't expected a Zen book, but here we are. This book is short and to the point, and presents a couple of very good
takes on not-just-tennis. It applies at the very least to every physical activity *and* anything that works like a
competition. The insights on physical activity have been immediately helpful for me in everyday life, and the thoughts
on competition will do the same once I've had time to think about them for a bit. Highly recommended.
