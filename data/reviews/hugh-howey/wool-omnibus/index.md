The **Wool Omnibus** is a collection of truly good scifi â€“ the old trope of isolated humans in a post-apocalyptic world, but without a huge predictable arc. You can predict some things some of the time, but not a lot, which I always appreciate. It's kind of depressing, but drew me in by showing realistic worlds and characters, and posing some pretty hard ethics questions.
