Every Heart a Doorway by *Seanan McGuire* is a nice little fantasy tale of the place where children go after going
through a Door to Another Place (Fairylands, for example), and then coming back. It's short, and sweet, and sad, and
gruesome. It's about real children, not a list of characters from other books, either. The gruesome part is the murder
mystery half of the book, but that's really only window dressing for the exploration of the characters and worlds. It's
a bit short, and I'd have liked to see more exploration of both the children and their worlds â€“ but I guess that's what
the sequel is there for.
