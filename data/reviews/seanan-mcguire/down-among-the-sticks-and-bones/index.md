I loved everything about **Down Among the Sticks and Bones** by *Seanan McGuire*. I think I might like it even better
than the first volume, and knowing about the future makes the book even better â€“ I bet it works without the added layer,
too, though. Seanan shows a lot of empathy for the two very different protagonists, and the language is both relateable
and lyrical. The cruel, cruel fairytale world, that still fits the children better than the cruelly boring and
narrow-minded reality we live in, hits very close to home.
