This was a *nice* read – It's very much a classical fantasy book in the better sense. The arc is generally coming-of-age
of the poor underdog boy, but in a sensible (while generic) setting. It was especially refreshing that all people in the
book are not generally malevolent, are able to talk about their differences, and that the rags-to-riches part happens
early and isn't dangled under the reader's nose forever.

The pacing and writing itself felt a bit clumsy – the time jumps and POV changes never happened when I wanted them, as
if Feist hadn't quite figured out how to make do with multiple protagonists yet. Also, the book just … stops, because
the original *Magician* was torn apart into two parts for the US-ian market (which I only found out after reading it).
Despite this, the characters usually had a bit more to them than was shown at first, and I appreciated a lot that
characters you might dismiss as side-kicks at first got more and more detailed over time (and sometimes even their own
plotline). It's a book that rewards attention.

In many ways, this is a weaker, more generic, but also more positive version of the similarly named *Assassin's
Apprentice*, which features more depth, but therefore also more people being dicks and idiots unto one another, which
isn't always fun reading.
