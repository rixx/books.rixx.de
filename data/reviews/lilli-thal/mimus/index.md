Mimus is the wonderfully cruel tale of Prince Florin. In the struggle of two nations, the baddies use the age-old plot
of suggesting peace-talks to come closer to their enemies. They capture the royal family and important court officials.
Everybody is imprisoned, except Prince Florin, who is humiliatingly apprenticed to the court jester. That's the short
setup. The book follows Florin in his reluctant apprenticeship to Mimus, through hardship, diplomacy, heartbreak and the
realisation that life goes on.

I loved this book and read it over and over.
