The Student Prince is very well-written Merlin (the TV show) fanfiction. You don't need to know the show to enjoy it: It
transplants the characters of Merlin, Arthur, Morgana, Lancelot et al into pre-Brexit UK, where they go to college and
deal with school and magic. Also national security. Also LGBT issues. I liked it a lot.
