  tldr: If you need a comic book to make fun of Lord Byron, this is for you.

A sweet comic book by the author of "My life as a background Slytherin", following the trio consisting of an
inconsistent annoying protagonist, a mysterious silent annoying side character and an Extremely Annoying Lord Byron on
their, uh, "adventures". It's funny, but I'm sure it works much better as single episodes, because the plot just â€¦
isn't. I'm always down to make fun of Byron, though.
