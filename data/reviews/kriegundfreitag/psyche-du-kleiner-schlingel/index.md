  tldr: kriegundfreitag comics as a book. You know if it's something you'll like –
    though they are way more depressing when reading them in a row.

As much as I love kriegundfreitag, I always feel like putting the whole book together is just … too much. It's
surprisingly dark, compared to reading just one post at a time. Still, the production quality is great, no simple
printout of a Twitter log (as certain other Twitter artists do), and I'm glad to have the book on my shelves!
