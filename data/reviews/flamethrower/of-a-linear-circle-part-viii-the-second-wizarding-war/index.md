Series continues to be good, with a few caveats: Tons of side characters being treated well means massively slower story
progress. General competency porn continues, but the Latin somehow got worse (while the complaints about bad Latin,
in-text, remained), which is mildly infuriating. Somebody explain to the author what a Vocative is, please.

Other than that: More old people, more not-really-dead people, a Death speaking in all-caps, plus the conclusion of the
main part of the series. It's not great, and it's often concerned with plugging its own plot holes, but it's decent
plotting, alright writing and also some competent adults kicking ass.
