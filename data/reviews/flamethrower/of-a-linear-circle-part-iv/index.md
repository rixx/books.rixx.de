Back to the present timeline, this (long) part of the ongoing series proves fun, and dazzles with payoff. Plus, a new
(mature, unexcited, beautiful) romance side-story. And then there's the extremely slow-building (4th long ) power
gradient involving the British monarchy ffs (Elizabeth turns to Nizar. “Now then. What are your intentions regarding my
kingdom, Lord Nizar?”).

Oh, and the late death of a child, honestly painful.

My only quibble is that a fic that complains nearly constantly about bad Latin (and that for four parts now) maybe
really should take care not to butcher Latin. But hey, win some, lose some.
