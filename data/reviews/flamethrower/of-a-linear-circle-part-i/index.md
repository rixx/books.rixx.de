Really decent fanfic: The brother of Salazar Slytherin mysteriously falls from his portrait, while Harry Potter has gone
missing after is 4th year at school. Nizar, the protrait, continues to oust Umbridge, be a teacher, correct everybody
about history, and be pretty badass â€“ with the help of a Severus Snape, whose backstory is kinda neat.

Extremely rapid setup, would feel hasty if there weren't, like, eleven more parts to this. Concise, emotionally
intelligent, and mostly also generally intelligent. I wonder how much of it was planned ahead of time.
