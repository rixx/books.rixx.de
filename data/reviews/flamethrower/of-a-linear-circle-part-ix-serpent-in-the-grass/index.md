The rest of this series was *so good*, but the last part just wasn't. It's backstory, in a way, but more importantly it
sees itself as just backstory. Nobody gets any depth, everything is narrated as if this was the Silmarillion, family
histories are recited as if we're in competition with the Old Testament â€¦ and then, emotionally important moments are
skipped and mentioned in passing. Yikes.

The only really good thing is how recent history, particularly WW1, WW2 and the development of atom bombs come into
play. That was nicely done.
