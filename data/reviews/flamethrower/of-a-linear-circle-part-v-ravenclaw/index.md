This part of the series goes **all in** on historical fiction: It follows the backdrop of Rowena Ravenclaw, who is
really called Hrodwunn of Hrabanklawa, Bavaria. We get some alright character building, and more importantly, some
really fun historical fiction: Hrodwunn is friends with Theophanu, the wife of Otto II, and so her fate ist connected to
the complex fate of the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire. It's well-researched and all kinds of fun (plus, part of it
takes place in Quedlinburg).

Seeing an extremely intelligent, often cutting, but also diplomatic noblewoman portrayed is really, really good â€“ bonus
points for her having children, and not being overly sentimental *or* uncaring. The story covers a lot of ground, avoids
tropes neatly, and all that in just six (though long) chapters.
