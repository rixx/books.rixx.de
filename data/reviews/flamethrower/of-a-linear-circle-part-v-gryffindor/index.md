More backstory, more carefully researched historical fiction. Well, some is inaccurate in minor details, but on the
level of getting one of the historical lords of Orkney wrong, which seems to be a cruel thing to count against a fanfic. 
Thanks to checking the story, also need to complain about the list of English (Wessex) kings with creative names such as
Æthelred, Æthelstan, Ælfweard, Ælfwynn, Æthelwold, Æthelhelm, Æthelberht, Æthelbald, Æthelwulf …

Other than that, some pretty on-the-nose representation (better than none) and dealing with the general trauma of living
Back Then and various more specific trauma. The protagonist is fidgety in extremely relatable ways, and generally way
too good to be true, but it *is* a backstory for a great hero, and I enjoyed it a lot.
