Novella, filling in some more backstory stuff. I'm not super well-versed in 14th-15th century Spain and France, so I
spent half the time on Wikipedia. Generally entertaining, but too much is already known through previous and later story
elements; and the author does not share Vonnegut's skill at telling you the ending, then making you care about how you
get there. (Unsurprising and completely fair â€“ asking for Vonnegut when reading fanfics is stupid).
