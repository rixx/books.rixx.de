We are not always what we seem, and hardly ever what we dream.

What is plucked will grow again,
What is slain lives on,
What is stolen will remain
– What is gone is gone.

What is sea-born dies on land,
Soft is trod upon.
What is given burns the hand
– What is gone is gone.

Here is there, and high is low;
All may be undone.
What is true, no two men know
– What is gone is gone.

Who has choices need not choose.
We must, who have none.
We can love but what we lose
– What is gone is gone.
