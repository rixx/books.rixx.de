Rating anthologies is always hard. **The Unicorn Anthology**, fittingly edited by *Peter S. Beagle* contained stories
that touched me, and stories that just passed some time. Different strokes for different folks, and all that. Most
stories tended to be dark and tragic, unsurprisingly enough. There are a couple of very good stories in there, so if the
whole mythical realism thing interests you, check it out. (An ARC in exchange for a review was provided by the publisher
via NetGalley.)
