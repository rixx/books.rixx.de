Peter S. Beagle is always interesting and never quite conventional. This book starts out with the titular Innkeeper's
Song, providing us with the entire plot condensed into a folk song, and then proceeds to elaborate in first-person
chapters from different viewpoints. It does so beautifully, and it's never predictable, and yet, I never felt really
close to the plot. I've felt this way about all books by Beagle so far, though, and I still like them.

There are a lot of individually cool things about this story! They just failed to grip me.
Also, idk how necessary the whole gender-pretend-group-sex scene was.
