My low rating may just be that I'm sick of generic superhero origin stories.
How to Move Spheres and Influence People
by *Marko Kloos* is a superhero origin story, I guess. It's about a teenager who discovers that she can move any spherical object with her mind. Very slice-of-life, not really going anywhere.
