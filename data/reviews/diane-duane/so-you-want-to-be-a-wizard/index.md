I really loved this book - it reminded me of Harry Potter, naturally, but better written and better thought-out. Magic
actually has a system, people have motivations and actions have actual consequences.

Nita and Kit are the most adorable protagonists, and very much to be taken seriously. Both human side-characters like
Nita's sister Dairine and parents, and the Advisory wizards seem very real, none too perfect. Even the Lone Power is not
completely evil.

Duane also has a way with words that made me swoon and/or feel frission on several occasions. This is definitely a book
to re-read and I'm now diving into the remainder of the series.
