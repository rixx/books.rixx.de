This one was again much better, and illustrates a lot of the reasons I enjoy this series. I love how Duane deals with autism here, in many ways. I love how she takes care to take it seriously, and doesn't paint it as a defect. Kit has difficulty connecting with it because of his preconceived ideas about how autism works.
I also like that we see how we see Nita's grieving in a really realistic way, without pity or anything.
