I loved this one. Even if you're not a space nut, or not a real sci-fi fan, I suspect this book will really work for
you. The combination of space, and magic, and physics, and human and alien conflict, sprinkled with a bit of time line
technicalities? Yeah, more, please.

Also, Carmela. I love an author who's not afraid to let the side-characters grow into upstaging the main cast.
