  tldr: Brutal second part, but in a good way. Extremely good character-building for
    the protagonists, and not grim or depressing despite the unrelenting plot.

Brutal, in a good way. Incredible character-building. Story arc is so Duane that you'd recognise it anywhere, but let's
not pretend that this is a bad thing.
