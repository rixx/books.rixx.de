  tldr: I don't tend to read graphical novels, but Stjepan Šejić is brilliant and
    this story of Harley Quinn is extremely well done – both the artwork and the story
    itself.

Stjepan Šejić is a brilliant artist, and he's done right by Harley Quinn. Good origin story, great writing, and *brilliant* artwork. I'm not really one for graphic novels and even I can tell that this goes above and beyond.
