I didn't enjoy this book at all – some characters were fun, but the story was terribly flat, easy to predict and boring.
Add in the length of the book and the semi-interesting rambling on architecture (seriously, I enjoyed a book on
cathedral building a few years ago, but this pseudo mix of literature and facts was just annoying). Most characters were
very flat aswell (good vs evil, bah), and overall I could have spent my time much better.
