I think, despite all its brilliance and cleverness, the best thing about Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious
Stones by *Samuel R. Delany* is the playfulness. It's a short story that's won both the Hugo and the Nebula Awards back
in the day, and rightfully so. The story is a good example of why I seem to like every Delany book I come across:
brilliant, lyrical and association heavy style. In Space. Very human and tongue-in-cheek.
