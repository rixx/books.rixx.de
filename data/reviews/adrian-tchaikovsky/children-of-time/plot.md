Two story lines. One: the last humans set out to start over again after burning down their planet. Even then, they still
fuck up everything, behave like neurotic aggressive monkeys, and are generally depressing and largely accurate
depictions of our species. Lame, boring, skip.

The spider plot (of accidentally uplifted spiders, due to humans fucking things up yet again) takes place in episodes
over thousands of years. Spiders get names based on their archetype, reused frequently: Portia, Bianca, Fabian and Viola
come to mind. Scientists, rebels, warriors, priestesses etc. Priestesses are needed because spiders start a cult
surrounding the signal of the incoming ship, which, predictably, isn't great. Other than that, I guess the most
interesting part of their cultural history is that at some point, they have to fight all the ants, which they then farm
and turn into computers. Then they do boring civilisation things, like catching plagues and developing cures, or
developing a culture where one gender is massively disadvantaged. Male spider suffrage is a recurring topic, and not a
sentence I expected to write today.

Meanwhile, the humans have a bunch of mutinies and have to figure out if they want to stay or to go (after figuring out
the whole spider things, painfully). People are only unfrozen for a time, and some basically sacrifice their lives (by
living it instead of being frozen) to get the ship to the planet. Spiders get space flight and attack the ship,
infecting humans with a peace-making nanovirus, which is what passes for a good ending. They coexist happily ever after
and even travel space. The end.

Oh, and I tend to get this confused with Deepnest in the Sky, so: this is not the one with the alien spiders who drive
cars.
