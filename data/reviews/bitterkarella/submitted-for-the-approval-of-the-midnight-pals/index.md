  tldr: First of the Kickstarter prints of the Midnight Society threads, sadly not
    very good to the point that reading them on Twitter is better.

Midnight Society is a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/midnight_pals) account that I really and honestly enjoy reading, so
when the recent Kickstarter came out, I backed it and got both the new and the old book â€“ but I shouldn't have bothered.
It's not that the production quality is bad (it's A4 print-on-demand, you get what you expect), it's that there was no
care taken with the presentation at all.

The account lives through its Twitter threads, and yet, each Tweet is just printed in a two-column layout, with generic
separators, without making it clear where one narrative starts or ends. Disappointing. Reading the old threads on
Twitter is better, and that's saying something.
