The young Friederike has red hair (really, really red) and gets bullied for it. Her teacher tries to help and gives up.
One of the only helpful adults is the postman, who is colour blind. Then it turns out that she has special powers due to
her hair, and has to find ways to get her apathetic aunt and sarcastic cat on board.

I kinda hated the extreme bullying going on. It didn't match anything I saw as a kid, and made the world look darker and
more cruel.
