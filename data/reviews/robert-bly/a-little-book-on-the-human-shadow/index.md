On a whim, I read A Little Book on the Human Shadow. It's very short, and it felt very much worth my time.

It's a pretty even split: I felt indifferent about a third of it (mostly the poetry commentary), I wasn't interested
in another third (very specific to US American culture, and of a certain time or generation), and the last third was
extremely useful and interesting. As it's a very short book, I count that as a win.

Here's what stood out as helpful in his notes on shadow work:

- Projecting your shadow means giving away energy and power, but is also a good and necessary step: Without projection,
  it would be much harder to work on reintegration.
- Eating your shadow is the last step, after you have *hidden* or *projected* it, then *noticed* (and possibly rejected)
  the discrepancy, found *justifications* (this part hurt in how specific it was), then *felt the lack* you produced,
  and only then, you approach the shadow.
- The shadow might be necessary, at least for a while, and absorbing it needs to be a careful, conscious act: Your ego
  is important, too, and hurting it in your efforts to embrace the shadow will hurt you as a person.
- Shadow work might require a big task or some other external motivators.
- Shadow work might lead to big life changes, and if you don't choose these changes (after a decade or so), that door
  closes, and you're stuck in a shallow understanding of yourself and the world.
- He lists some archetypes and shadows, some of which felt familiar or offputting, both of which is a good starting
  point for work.
- Shadow work includes playing parts, coming up with scary/dark "spirits", eg in your art, writing, chasing down the
  shadow, following your dislikes and strong reactions: both in other people and in anything you encounter.
- He advocates to neither repress nor express your shadow immediately: instead, feel it deeply, honour it, and then (if
  appropriate) find a mode of expression that is not immediate ("savage") and rather **you** and natural ("wild")


Two refreshing things occurred to me: Some parts of the book are very gendered, and surprisingly enough in a useful way,
I thought. I also liked that generally, Bly often just points in directions, or says "there's something more here, but I
really don't know what it is".
