All my notes are lost to a hardware disaster, so the tl;dr is just: material pop-science, fun read, drags on in places.
Nice without being great. The chapters on steel and chocolate were great, the one on concrete could have been great but
instead was grating. All in all cool info, presented well, if you can stand the voice.
