Absolutely adorable. I read this when I was in the mood for wholesome short fic, and this take on a haunted house
delivered 100%. It's plain fluff with some attempt at heartstring-tugs. Nothing more – but great at what it does.

Highlights: The moment the house realises what makes haunted houses go evil – they don't want to be alone. Very
Pratchettian in its intentions. And how adorable is its conviction that the tired, skeptic dad doesn't need to know that
his nice new podcast room doesn't *technically* exist?
