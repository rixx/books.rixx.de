  tldr: Delightfully snarky, but fewer fluctuations in writing quality would've been
    nice.

Delightfully snarky fanfic, in which we get a mostly canon-compliant inner monologue of McGonagall, mostly about
Umbridge, ridiculous students and absurd colleagues. Good length, good general writing style, but lots of fluctuations
in quality: Inner monologue good, storytelling mediocre, I think.

Also, what is it with fanfic authors misspelling “Dolores”?
