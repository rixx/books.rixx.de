Elanus by *Ursula Poznanski* is an alright YA thriller/mystery. (Keep in mind that I'm not the intended audience
anymore, though). She writes a very good unreliable/unsympathetic protagonist â€“ a way too smart 17-year old boy, who by
way of his self-built illicit drone stumbles into a dangerous secret at his new school. Very solid writing. It's very
clear from the start that the protagonist is an asshole, but with YA you'd want to make this clear to encourage
engagement with the book (and to prevent any kids from finding him too much of a role model). Well-researched in terms
of technical capacity, well-written, and while the twist is a bit predictable, the book is still solid.
