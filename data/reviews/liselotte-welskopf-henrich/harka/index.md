This series … weirdly enough, I wouldn't say that it has had a huge influence on me, despite being one of my favourites
at the time. And the first part was my favourite among the series (once I got to read it – my introduction was a
shortened mashup of volumes 4-6, if I recall correctly). Seeing the young Harka encounter hardship and deal with it with
strength and grace was enchanting.
