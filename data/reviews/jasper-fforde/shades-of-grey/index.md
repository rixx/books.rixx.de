Chromatacia is Brave New World, but on drugs. Everybody can see only one colour, and your colour determines your social
class, while your strength of perception determines your position. Half of the book's strength is in its puns: the
Colortocracy, the Swatchman (doctor) … It's a classic dystopy with a punny twist.

The characters are all plausible but not terribly likeable, but the world building *rules*, and the plot is compelling.
It does end on a bit of a cliffhanger, but there is enough conclusion to the main plot arc that I felt content.

Poor Fforde, publishing this book two years ahead of Fifty Shades of Grey.
