Embarassing, or at least a sign of aging: This book did not stand up to a re-read for me.

That's a bit surprising because it was absurdly important to me at the time. I gave it to my classmates. I got people
into reading. I loved it dearly. I hadn't known you were *allowed* to have this much fun! Now that I know more books of
the genre, and more non-books of the genre, I'm less amazed. It's still a good concept, it's just that the execution is
lacking. Sometimes. Often. The worldbuilding is absolutely amazing and the plot is â€¦ not.
