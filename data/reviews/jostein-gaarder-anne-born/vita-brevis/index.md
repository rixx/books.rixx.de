Jostein Gaarder is hit-and-miss for me at the best of times, and this wasn't the best of times. *Vita Brevis* is the
fictional letter (complete with frame plot about finding it in an old book store blah blah) of St Augustine's wife to
the man himself after he became famous. It's St Augustine fanfiction. Not my genre.
