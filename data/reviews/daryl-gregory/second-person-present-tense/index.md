  tldr: Brilliant short story, available online. Cuts off rudely instead of being
    a book, making it no less brilliant. Very technically a zombie story.

Yes, wow, please. Cuts off rudely instead of being a book. I'm slightly shaken, for the better. Also, note how this is a
zombie story, and not a zombie story at all. If not for the lack of a catchphrase, I might make this my new go-to
reference instead of Omelas.
