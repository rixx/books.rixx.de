While I liked *Greg Egan*'s other novels, **Diaspora** didn't grip me at all and was very hard to get through. The fact
that it revolves around an advanced species that can change itself to any degree it wants to made it hard to feel
sypathy with any of the characters. The beginning was really strong, describing how their civilizations and
personalities are formed. But after that, to my feeling the book consisted only of excalating physicsbabble and
arbitrary personality changes, and this escalation continued right upon the not quite satisfying end.
