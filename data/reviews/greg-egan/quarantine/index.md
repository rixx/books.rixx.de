This was lots of fun. The story is told in a four-star way, but it has so fucking many great concepts: Having a fuckton
of software for your brain, and the implications of loyalty software, of cours. But mostly the idea that humans are
unique in collapsing the wave functions of possibilities, and the implications of xenocide that come with it.
Wow. And the implications of learning to suppress that reflex, and having human made quantum computing in the brain. â™¥
