  tldr: Reading more recommended fan fiction. This one is interesting because of the
    absurd amount of words spent on processing emotions, as if balancing several lives
    of repression.

Decent Severitus, I suppose â€“ okay writing, absurd amounts of processing, and follows the hurt/comfort rules to a t.
