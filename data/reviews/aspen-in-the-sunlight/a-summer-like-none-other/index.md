  tldr: Like the previous part, only that it doubles down on the excessive processing
    in unprecedented ways. Is this going somewhere?

Doubles down on the weaknesses of the first part: excessive processing, repetitive and predictable. Okay writing, occasionally humorous dialogue, bug still little action spread out by virtue of extreme blathering.
