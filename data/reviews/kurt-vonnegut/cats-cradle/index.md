(Spoiler free note to future self when I once again start confusing the different Vonnegut titles: This is the ice one.)

Not that spoilers can do much to a Vonnegut book in general, and this one is no exception: The actual plot is only an
accessory to keeping the book appropriately strange and invested in its absurdist vibe.  I enjoy Vonnegut as a rule, and
Cat's Cradle is no difference. I re-read it because it featured heavily in [Among
Others](/jo-walton/among-others/), but I was overdue for a re-read anyways.

Cat's Cradle features lots of the prophet Bokonon (who cares), and his concept of a *karass* (I care!): A group of
people your light is tangled up with for no very logical reason. Bokonon, of course, is made to be quotable:

- "Ah, God," says Bokonon, "what an ugly city every city is!"
- "Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God."
- "Maturity," Bokonon tells us, "is a bitter disappointment for which no remedy exists, unless laughter can be said to
  remedy anything."
