2BR02B is a very *Kurt Vonnegut* short story about a future with immortal people and very quid-pro-quo population
control. Think Futurama's suicide booth. It's gruesome in this Vonnegut style that shows you reality, but in a very
specific detached angle. I read it when I was feeling down, and it did a good job kicking me back into a more
grounded view, as ill-fitting as that sounds.
