Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the
questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in
a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you
because you would not be able to live them.

And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will
then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the
answer.
