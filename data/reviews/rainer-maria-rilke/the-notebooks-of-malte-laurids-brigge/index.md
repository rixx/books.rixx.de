Rilke's poetry is always better than his other works (and than most other poetry). The life of the sensitive author
stand-in protagonist in the big city is anxiety inducing, depressing, just … too much. And Rilke describes it perfectly.
Over one hundred years later, life is even faster, even louder, even more relentless – one wonders if today's Rilkes can
even survive long enough to write about it.
