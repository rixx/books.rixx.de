  tldr: White-hat assassin siblings have to save the not-king from poison attempts
    and defend the realm. Nice inversion of the shining city into the decadent city
    on a rotting foundation.

White-hat assassin siblings have to defend the realm. It's a bit generic. Good parts: the role of the protagonist as
defensive poison expert (unusual and refreshing), and a well-handled siege story. The truly stand-out part of the story
was starting with the narrator highlighting the wonderful high-culture city they live in, and then pivoting over time to
show the rotting foundations the realm is built on. Well-done, though having only the perspective of the whiny
aristocracy took some getting used to.

Not interesting enough to continue.
