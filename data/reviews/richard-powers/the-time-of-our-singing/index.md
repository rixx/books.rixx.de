This book made me dream, and made me miss singing. I loved it intensely - half of it. The other half was overly
dramatic, overwrought, and more in love with its own understanding of music than with having any sort of plot or
tension. Sadly, the two halves are completely woven together, so you have to take one to get the other. I found the read
well worth my time, but your mileage will vary.
