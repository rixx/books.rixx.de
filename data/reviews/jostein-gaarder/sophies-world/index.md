Meh. Meh, I say. Books that preach at me have to be outstanding to convince me, not tedious and annoying and boring.
They have to have characters and good reasons for their preaching, not two-dimensional cardboard cutouts who get a bit
of action before it's time to get back to your regularly scheduled sermon. And they have to have content that is
fascinating, not just reurgitating old philosophers and assume I care.

I read Sophie's World at exactly the age it's marketed to and I didn't like it one bit. It was as preachy as the Narnia
books without even having a clear agenda. No, thank you.
