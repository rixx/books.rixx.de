I find Gaarder grating when he's preaching about philosophy, I find him unbearable when he starts on religion. It
doesn't help that every of his book has this "teenager stumbles on mysterious story, lets said story happily preach at
him". I didn't enjoy the whole time travel thing either, and it didn't even put me in a Christmas mood.
