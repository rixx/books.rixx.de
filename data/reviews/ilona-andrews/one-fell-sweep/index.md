  tldr: The Innkeeper series with more of an ensemble cast. Not bad, but worse than
    the previous books, I'm probably going to stop reading here.

Ensemble casts are very hit and miss for me, and this one was a miss. The Innkeeper Chronicles have an ensemble cast by
design, but this book added more family (the protagonist's sister and niece) to the mix, and that one plus a siege story
just didn't do it for me. Still a nice comfort read, but not generally it.

Also, the romance handling has grated on me a bit from the beginning and this book (particularly due to the sister's
presence) made it quite a bit worse. I'm probably going to stop reading the series here, but it was a nice comfort read
and I don't regret the time I spent with it.
