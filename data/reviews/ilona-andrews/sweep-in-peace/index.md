  tldr: More fantastical innkeeper stories. This time – intergalactic diplomacy edition. Enjoyable comfort read.

More magical tavern innkeeper stories! This one wasn't that different from the first part. It has found its footing, and
instead of going for more of the usual urban fantasy romance stuff, it is about an intergalactic peace conference. Our
protagonist has to handle three warring species under her roof, and it's fun and comfy and an all-around good time.
Still not the height of … anything, but good fun.
