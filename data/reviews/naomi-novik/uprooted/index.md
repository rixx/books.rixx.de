Uprooted by *Naomi Novik* was a perfect fantasy story/fairytale. It's got all the right parts (dark magic, regular
magic, unimpressed heroine, ambivalent wizard, etc), but isn't terribly predictable, and forms real characters instead
of shadows of well-known archetypes. By following the easy-to-like first-person narrator Agnieszka, and seeing her
relate to the Dragon, her best friend Kasia, and all the others, painted a vivid and realistic picture of the world. We
even get a surprising amount of moral ambivalence, considering the genre. A very good book. I may start to read Naomi
Novik's fantasy series if Uprooted is any indicator for that series' quality.
