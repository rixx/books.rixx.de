The Stars My Destination by *Alfred Bester* is a scifi classic, and most of those don't work for me. This one was better
than average, but I still felt like I was in a weird dream. I have a low tolerance for people behaving horribly and/or
stupidly at the moment, which is certainly part of it. I enjoyed the exploration of what the power of personal
teleportation at a whim would do to society, and I laughed at the outrageously absurd parts of the novel, but the middle
part felt like a drag, not due to lack of action, but due to the characters being weird/horrible/stupid or alternating
between those three in rapid succession.
