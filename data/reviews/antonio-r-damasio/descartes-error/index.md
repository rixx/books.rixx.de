  tldr: Not so groundbreaking now as it was 25 years ago when it was publised, but
    still a solid overview over the role of emotions in human thinking and reasoning.

Didn't hold much new information for me, because its contents have grown so accepted and foundational in the 25 years
since publication. Nevertheless it provides a solid fundamental overview in a very readable way, despite also dealing in
a bit of technical details.
