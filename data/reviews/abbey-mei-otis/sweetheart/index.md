A bit on the nose, but still nice: Sweatheart is a well-written very short story by *Abbey Mei Otis* that is first sweet
and then chilling in the path the story takes – nothing too special either, just a perfectly fine scifi short.

I'm not sure if the author intends "yay nightly deportations of aliens are fine" to be the moral, or if she wanted to
show why and how people will come to believe these things are fine. Very mixed feelings – she does the latter way, but
I'm worried she actually wants to sell the message that peace is more important than both love and morals. Hmmmm.
