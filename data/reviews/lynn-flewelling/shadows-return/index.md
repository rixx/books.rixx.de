  tldr: This is where I stop reading the Nightrunner series. The protagonists are
    kidnapped by NOT AT ALL ARABS who proceed to torture them for the rest of the
    book, until they escape.

This is where I stop reading the Nightrunner series. The protagonists are kidnapped after a lengthy exposition part. The
kidnappers are, well, how do I put this? From a country where rich men keep harems and slaves, and where the masters
have darker skin and curly beards. That's not even fantasy racism, it's just regular racism. Evil arabs seem to have
been acceptable way longer than most other lazy racist stereotypes.

To make matters worse, after getting kidnapped â€¦ nothing much happens. Protagonist #1 has to endure alchemic experiments
with his body (and further on, deal with a homunculus made from his precious half-blood juices, eww). Protagonist #2
gets tortured by an old enemy. Nothing else happens.

Until they predictably escape and the book ends.
