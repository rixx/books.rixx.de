  tldr: Very solid time travel short story, probably even better for people from the
    rural US. Extremely strong on the atmosphere.

A Time to Reap by Elizabeth Bear was a very solid time travel story, probably even better for people from the US.
Extremely strong atmosphere â€“ I remembered both the characters and the atmosphere mostly by way of the plot.
