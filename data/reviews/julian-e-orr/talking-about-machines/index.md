This is technical anthropology, and it is thorough and much better than you'd expect from a potentially dry dissertation
from 1990, described as an “underground classic among ethnographers of work”. The central thesis of the book is that
(technical) **knowledge is a socially distributed resource that is transported by way of oral culture** and that
**debugging works by constructing a narrative between technician, customer and machine**. More details below, but this
is both a central insight, well described and documented, and applicable to most areas of (work) life.

Orr was shadowing Xerox technicians at their work of servicing and repairing photocopiers (helpfully, Orr had learnt
this job, on slightly different machines, too, so he wasn't just an annoying nosy interloper). He initially describes
their work as a “continuous highly skilled improvisation within a triangular relationship of technician, customer, and
machine”, which very clearly demonstrates the respect and depth Orr displays throughout the book. He was only
accompanying them during their work hours, there were no additional structured interviews.

## Debugging as narrative

In Orr's experience, a diagnosis involves the creation of a coherent narrative explaining the problem, starting from
available pieces of unintegrated information that is transformed into a coherent narrative. This narrative is both used
to fix the problem, and to share the whole story of problem, diagnosis and fix with colleagues (see below).

A significant part of the job is social. Extracting information from non-technical users, discovering their
understanding, and then reflecting the technician's knowledge in a way that will shape the users' behaviour is tricky,
and also always fraught with office politics, history, colleague's opinions and so on. They are very aware themselves
that users are a large part of the equation – they even have a saying: “Don't fix the machine; fix the customer!”

(Side note: I'm shorthanding Orr's “diagnosis and repair” to “debugging” here.)

## War stories

Once a story has been formed by means of diagnosis, and performed by means of repair, it can be shared with the
professional community. The tellers use it to build their identity (either of competence, when in the starring role, or
as knowledgeable part of the community, when repeating somebody else's story). This comes with a certain civil
competitiveness that manifests in one-upmanship in their stories about hard fixes, or challenges when the narrator only
tells the problem, and asks the audience to provide diagnosis.

This social cohesion also shows up in the interesting way that technicians are more worried about the social damage to
another technician, when they have to take a job in their territory, than about the machine they are servicing, because
they know full well that social relationships are harder to repair than machines.

## Knowledge as distributed resource

Orr observes that the telling of debugging narratives both demonstrates and shares the technicians' mastery, creating
and celebrating their identities (in this case: as masters of the black arts of dealing with machines and customers,
both). They provide information about technical matters – past fixes, emerging problems, warnings of incorrect
documentation –, but also social and administrative topics, like changes among customers, area distributions, and
office politics.

These stories, usually shared during meals, are necessary for the technicians to remain capable and perform their work.
The official documentation is not always correct, and rarely sufficient. Well-known workarounds int he fields (starting
with valid substitutes for individual parts and ending with MacGuyver style solutions to common problems) are only
communicated here.


## On the nature of work

It's interesting to see notes from a time when service work was still coming into its own. The remark that “Leftists
routinely orient themselves to service work by assuming that service workers are a new proletariat even though most
service workers apparently don't see themselves this way.” has aged well.

This time also reflects that the technicians' status straddled both worlds: They were skilled workers dressed like
office workers, ties and all, their tool boxes made to look like briefcases, while also performing dirty work, setting
them apart from pure office workers.

Orr also pointedly observes that this shift has also shifted the meaning of “to work” to have an added, possibly even
primary, meaning of “to be employed” rather than “to do a thing”.

Another still very relevant comment is that the definition of work seems to be up to management, who focus on the
activities required to deliver a product, and disregard other equally necessary activities, that need then to be snuck
in by people on the ground. For example, there is no alotted time for services technicians to casually visit the
clients, inquire as to the state of everything, provide quick checks and education. But these encounters are vital, and
technicians take care to get them done despite their tenuous status as not-really-work.

Orr also mentions that all the common management definitions of work are focused on individual workers, while the fact
that work is commonly done by a group and an emergent professional community is rarely acknowledged. In this example,
all work would be much, much worse or even impossible without the frequent shared lunches and exchanges of experience.
However, no management would have classed those things as work.

## Other Notes

I liked the apt description of the relationship between customers and technicians as the “contract between the
customers' need and the technicians' ability”, and he goes on to describe the relationship: “The principal issues for
the technicians in this triangular interaction are control and understanding, and one reward for achieving the two is
their own identity as competent technicians.”

Equally, I liked the observation that technicians have trouble reasoning about details of the machine when they can't
see it in front of them. They can still figure out the larger scale problems, but they don't remember things like the
location of individual components in the machine. They also sometimes leave the technical field and get promoted to
be managers, but few succeed there, most return to being technicians: “Most technicians would rather remain a
technician-hero than become an organization manager”.

“The division between technician and senior technician is just one of seniority and salary; reputation and skill are not thought to be related to this distinction.” – things never change. And, how Marxian: “The occupational community shares few cultural values with the corporation; technicians from all over the country are much more alike than a technician and a salesperson from the same district.”

“Technicians claim to be skilled, but the claim is problematic in that service management believes the technicians can
be replaced by semiskilled labor with a good set of instructions.” – which leads to worse documentation, because they
are only given simple steps through well-defined problems, instead of enough documentation for a deeper understanding of
how the machine works. When the documentation is used, they try to guess what the author wanted, and why they wanted it,
and contrasting the suggested course of action with their own diagnosis. Because the second reality diverges from the
problems the manual writers have anticipated, it's again down to skill, and shared oral tradition. (Another reason for
very limited documentation is that it's required to be suitable for machine translation, which, as you can imagine,
limited the permitted vocabulary severely.) The documentation also operates on different assumptions: it thinks the
technicians only want to fix a technical problem, whereas “A technician's primary goal is to keep the customer happy,
and this includes but is not limited to fixing the machine as necessary.” – they have to assure the customer that
everything is under control, provide the correct amount of detail and reassurance, and so on.

“What really holds ·their interest is a situation they do not understand.”

Machines are very much not all the same: technicians talk about the ones in their territories as individuals, with their
specific histories, users, problems, anticipated problems, past fixes requiring special attention, and so on.


In most of the hard diagnoses I observed, solution was discovered through reinterpretation of known facts and following the new interpretation with new investigations. This is one of the reasons that consultations and joint troubleshooting are so popular and effective. The presence of someone else guarantees another perspective
-=-=-=-=-=-
discourse among the technicians appears to presume that all competent members of the community will tell stories.
-=-=-=-=-=-
This brevity is a matter of cultural propriety and competent practice; it would be inappropriate to waste everyone's time repeating the superfluous to make a well-structured story,
-=-=-=-=-=-
These stories are anecdotes of experience, told with as much context and technical detail as seems appropriate to the situation of their telling. At a minimum they name the technician doing the work, the machine to which it was done, the problem, and its solution; in the majority of cases I observed, the technician telling the story is the one to whom it happened.
-=-=-=-=-=-
There is an inherent uncertainty in the situation of diagnosis. In difficult diagnoses the technicians are contending with the limits of their knowledge.
-=-=-=-=-=-
They do not know whether they have overlooked something, whether there are more facts to .gather, or whether this is a new problem that is completely beyond their experience and understanding. They do not know whether they lack a fact or an interpretation. Their experience suggests the latter, that the answer lies in gaining the proper perspective on things they already know;
-=-=-=-=-=-
Other stories are told as a challenge, to see if the other technician is good enough to recognize the situation described.
-=-=-=-=-=-
Stories are also told to instruct.
-=-=-=-=-=-
However, the technicians are fond of the saying, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"
-=-=-=-=-=-
The problem was solved by a fortuitous encounter with the customer who had done this, and the story celebrates this triumph, while warning of the unimaginable depths of customer failure to understand how to deal properly with the machine.
-=-=-=-=-=-
Almost everyone in the corporation knows that technicians tell war stories. The official attitude toward war stories varies directly with distance from the field,
-=-=-=-=-=-
Mayan midwives' stories about birth were normally told while attending a birth, as part of the process of deciding what to do next.
-=-=-=-=-=-
Ilongot culture in that they emphasize the portions of hunting experience that Ilongot find interesting, omit those portions that every culturally competent listener ,knows, and finally celebrate the hunter's prowess.
-=-=-=-=-=-
some experienced technical specialists report incoherence as the principal characteristic of a technician in trouble.
-=-=-=-=-=-
In fact, good reputations are discussed almost entirely in terms of technical skills, while bad ones seem primarily to be associated with unsystematic approaches to problems, a form of losing control. Although the need for social skills is explicitly recognized, no technician's reputation seems to be enhanced thereby.'
-=-=-=-=-=-
there is an ·obvious pattern of challenge and response in the joking. It is never done in the presence of customers, where technician behavior is carefully controlled and most of the jokes they tell are at their own expense.
-=-=-=-=-=-
The technicians choose to give accomplishing ·the task priority over use of the prescribed means, and so they resolve problems in the field any way they can, apparently believing that management really wants accomplishment more than strict observation of the prescriptions for work.
-=-=-=-=-=-
the discussion of technicians' work practice makes it clear that de-skilling is not possible in any real sense.
-=-=-=-=-=-
The management of the corporation for which the technicians work has pursued a strategy of de-skilling through the use of directive documentation. This does not actually deprive the workers of the skills they have, however; it merely reduces the amount of information given to them.
-=-=-=-=-=-
The fragmentation of work caused by the more successful attempts ·at de-skilling has increased management's control at the expense of the community.
-=-=-=-=-=-
the community may counter it by devaluing promotions.
-=-=-=-=-=-
the process of working and learning together creates a situation that the workers value, and they resist having it disrupted by their employers through events such as a
-=-=-=-=-=-
reorganization of the work. This resistance can surprise employers who think of labor as a commodity that can be arranged to suit their ends.
-=-=-=-=-=-
It is also a weapon in struggles with those companies: railroaders are not allowed to strike, but working to rule, depriving the :company of the benefit of their skills at timing operations, essentially makes the railroad inoperable.
-=-=-=-=-=-
The significant thing about these studies is that the examination of practice reveals a complexity that cannot be seen from a distance; this complexity constrains how the work can be done and therefore has crucial implications for those making policy about work. Sailing a ship is not the same on the ocean as on the Great Lakes; time for railroaders is not simply a matter of having an accurate timepiece. Similarly, field service work is not just a matter of fixing broken machines but requires the maintenance of a triangular relationship between customers, machines, and
