Surprisingly good: Crichton's version of Beowulf, told from the perspective of an Arab traveller who gets taken along on
the famous journey. The book strikes a decent balance among several things: the voice of an old epos and modern pacing;
displaying the clash between the two cultures while also being an adventure book; proposing plausible origins for the
myth while also making them sound sufficiently magical. <span class="spoilers">Neanderthals as the origin of Grendel
were a particularly neat touch.</span>

Attention to detail was also nice: vowel shifts, evolution of place names traced backwards â€“ some of it plausible, some
pure fiction. I also enjoyed the pretty straightforward, no-nonsense discussion of fear, confusion, pride, and similar
emotions that are often only implied, but never mentioned out loud in adventures like this. Well handled all around.
