The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms by *N.K.Jemisin* is solid Fantasy, with cool mythology, a decent protagonist and good other characters, and absolutely nothing wrong with it â€“ it just didn't really come to life for me. Huge bonus points for a very cool ending, though! Not sure I'll continue the series, though, to be honest.

As a side note, coming into this from **Broken Earth**, it's fascinating to see some similarities, but also a huge improvement in the writing. (That's not to say that this book is bad, it's perfectly good and at the upper end of regular Fantasy, it's just that Broken Earth goes above and beyond.)
