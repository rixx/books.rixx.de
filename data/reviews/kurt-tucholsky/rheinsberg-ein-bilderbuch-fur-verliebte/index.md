  text: Tucholsky didn't live as long as Zweig, but his story also invokes a deep
    nostalgia for the world of yesterday (though, granted, not on purpose).

Tucholsky wasn't much of a novelist – he shines in his newspaper articles, and sometimes, Kästner-esque, in his poems.
This is a slightly cheesy (but sweet!) romance. It's cute, and the dialogue is so real it latches onto your brain, but
it's not much of anything else.
