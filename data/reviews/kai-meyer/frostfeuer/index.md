Snow Queen is a terrifying fairy tale. This adaptation is similarly dark and way more Russian. Our protagonist is a poor
orphan who has never left the hotel she was born in. And now she has to help a mysterious guest against a mighty
sorceress? All the while discovering a plot on Tsar Alexander's life? Worth a read.
