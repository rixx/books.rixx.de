Magical Venice with mermaids (talking, dangerous, rarely helpful, but the exceptions are amazing)! Magical egypt with
sphinxes (talking, dangerous, rarely helpful, but the exceptions are amazing)! Magical hell world with demons
(dangerous, no exceptions)! Mirror makers, mirror worlds, young orphans, dangerous travels. Betrayal, loyalty. You know
the drill. It's not the best and not the most creative YA, and the worldbuilding is a bit iffy in places, but it's
creative enough to make it up to me.

The characters are engaging, even when the story is a bit, uhm, trashy? But I'm a sucker for worldbuilding and good
characters, and Magical Venice!! But if plot is important to you, maybe sit this one out.
