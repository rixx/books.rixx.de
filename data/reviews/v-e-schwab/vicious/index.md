  tldr: Did not finish. Superhero story from the perspective of a villain.

Villain protagonists are cool in theory, but hard to do well, and I didn't feel like Schwab got it right. It's not that
there is no motivation or background, it's more that the protagonist is an asshole and I don't enjoy spending time with
assholes.
