I came into the first volume of *Liu Cixin*'s **Remembrance of Earth's Past** with high expectations, as there was
somewhat of a hype surrounding the book. It's nearly as good as (and too me, evocative of) Subjective Cosmology by Greg
Egan. It's very nice physics (and physicists) scifi. The characters were irritatingly flat a lot of the time (a common
hard scifi illness), and often felt over the top to me.  The beginning of the book was slow, and compared to
that, the ending felt sudden (not rushed, mind, only sudden), and I missed some information and worldbuilding there – I
can't be more specific without heavy spoilers. I appreciated the somber ending (although the very final scene
was over the top for me).  The translation was decent. There remained occasional phrases that sounded
weird/unidiomatic, but it happens, especially if there's so much culture to translate.

By the way, shout-out to the wonderful Mastodon reading group at [#sffbookclub](<a target="_blank"

discussed the book in August, too.
