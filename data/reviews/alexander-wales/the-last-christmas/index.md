This story has potential, but rationalists and their aversion to humour ruins it.  The Last Christmas is a fun
premise, but way too short to build it up properly, and so it ends up all over the place. Still: It's short, and
a nice read, so if you want to see how an engineer deals with suddenly being Santa, go check it out.
