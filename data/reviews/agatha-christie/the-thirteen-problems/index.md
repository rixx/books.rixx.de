This collection of short Miss Marple stories was enjoyable. While Agatha Christie mostly follows her pattern of
"the most vulnerable-looking person is most suspicious", I don't read mysteries for the plot, so I didn't care all that
much. But the characterisation of poor old Miss Marple was very entertaining to read! I remember how this narration
device got boring and even annoying when I read most of the Miss Marple books in one go, but over longer intervals, it
works very well.

After reading this book [and a Poirot
one](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2020/the-mysterious-affair-at-styles) back to back, my current
preference of the [Detection Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_Club) era that I've read is: Dorothy Sayers,
Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, Chesterton. And I think it's no accident that female writers are leading my list:
First off, to be recognised as a good writer as a woman you had to perform to higher standards than men, of course. But
also, I think you write better characters if you're more observant, and marginalisation strengthens observation skills.
