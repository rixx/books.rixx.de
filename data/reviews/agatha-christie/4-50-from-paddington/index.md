There's no way I can think of this book without seeing and hearing the movie. The book veered a bit too far into the
"here, have some train schedules" direction â€“ I'm not much of a mystery reader, the details bore me and I never try to
puzzle them out on my own. For good reason: Miss Marple books often work with hazy clues and psychology magic.
