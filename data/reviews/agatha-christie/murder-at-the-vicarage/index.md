This is where it begins: The tons of Miss Marple book start here, introducing the gentle but sharp old lady who can
solve every crime by reducing it to some small village squabble. I generally enjoy the Miss Marple mysteries more than
the Poirot ones, mostly because Hastings is so incredibly obnoxious. But both series have in common that the bulk of the
mysteries are not particularly noteworthy and I often can't remember any details.
