This was one of the few Miss Marple mysteries that I remembered for years. It didn't vanish into the blur of "eh,
somebody died and Miss Marple solved it". Partially because I found it genuinely creepy, and partially because
it's an unusual setup: New homeowners feel creeped out, and particularly Gwenda feels bad vibes, is scared of the
dark, remembers doors where none are etc. Good setup, and a neat solution.
