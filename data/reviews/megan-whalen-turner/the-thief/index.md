The Thief by *Megan Whalen Turner* is a pretty short fantasy novel placed in a fictional world that feels fairly Mediterranean-medieval. We follow a young thief, who is retrieved from prison to steal something for (and with) the King's Magus. The world is fleshed out in an organic way when you read it â€“ the author takes occasions like passing a certain kind of field or tree to tell us about the general state of the country, agriculture, etc. Evening meals are vehicles to tell us about legends and the general state of mind of people. But looking back, I know only bits and pieces of the world, and that's not a satisfying feeling.

The book meandered quite a bit, I feel, and the big ending didn't pay off for me emotionally as much as I would have liked it to. All characters were either extremely annoying or at least sufficiently annoying for me to decide that I won't continue this series.
