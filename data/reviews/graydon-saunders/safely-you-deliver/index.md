  tldr: This one is pure worldbuilding, but three books into a series is a good place
    for that.

Similar to the previous book, we get to see the posse from a different point of view. There is a unicorn, and Saunders
has a good take on unicorns. It explains the world some more, both the state and the people. I liked it, but I wouldn't
have liked to read it as a standalone.
