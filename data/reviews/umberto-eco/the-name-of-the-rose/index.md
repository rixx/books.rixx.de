Medieval monks? Thinly disguised opportunities to lecture the reader about history and theology? Showing off your
knowledge of obscure and less obscure references? It might sound obnoxious, but Eco is obviously just a giant nerd and
is having fun, and I fell for his joy more than anything. Though I do love monasteries and medieval backgrounds and
libraries and clever protagonists, so that helped.
