Content warnings were made for this book. A friend of mine read The Metamorphosis while transitioning, and *please*
don't do that. Not while you're transitioning, or in inner turmoil, or feeling alienated or depressed. Or when you're in
a good mood and would like to keep it. Kafka will eat your good mood.
