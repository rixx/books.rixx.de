The Vor Game is another Miles book in the **Vorkosigan Saga**, and as usual, it is a lot of fast-paced fun. I was
lost over the first third or so, where it wasn't clear where the plot was going, and every time I thought I had it
figured out, it switched to an entirely new track. I spent a good amount of time wondering how those threads would be
tied back together, and the story did not disappoint at all – but it does turn out that the first third was a standalone
novella at first, explaining the break.

I love that while the Miles stories are mostly fun and action, all characters are consistent, and have noble and
less-noble motivations, capabilities, and dreams. Not only Miles himself (who could be a Mary Sue were it not for his
depression, and social issues, and missing ability to stop escalating, and … see? Good character building!), but all of
his friends, comrades, subordinates, bosses, and enemies.  Love the series.
