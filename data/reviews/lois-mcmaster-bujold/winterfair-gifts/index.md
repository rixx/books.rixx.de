Wedding stories – I accidentally read this one out of order, as it belongs before *Diplomatic Immunity*, both to get the
couple settled, and to introduce Roic as a character in his own right. Oh well. The wedding was, of course, very
Milesian in every way. As this a novelly, Bujold mostly uses it to show us all our old favourites again, and still
manages to cram new characters in there, plus something resembling a plot.

I was afraid that Bujold would shortchange Roic, which she mostly didn't. I appreciated Taura more than anything (except
from Aral and Cordelia, duh). I'm not a big Roic fan per se – he *is* boring, you have to admit – but he's a
utterly consistent, well-written character who sees implicit development over the course of three or four
books.
