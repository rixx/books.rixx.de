Headcanon: Bujold discovered that her vaguely-somewhat-Russian scifi setting allowed her to tell a Chernobyl Baba Yaga
story, and then she just had to do it. Sometimes the prompt is stronger than the story.

That's a bit mean: The novella provides a good backdrop for the books, showing Ekaterin being very much Lady Vorkosigan,
with a bit of fluff about the kids on the side, and a bit of horror about other kids front and center. Didn't do much
for me, but still time spent well.
