The Mountains of Mourning is a very touching **Vorkosigan** novella by *Lois McMaster Bujold*. It's deeply impressive to
me how very emotional and touching this novella gets in under 150 pages, while still maintaining the character and tone
of the overall series. Our favourite hero, Miles, confronts a backwater village while investigating a child murder. The
crippled man confronting a society where killing crippled children is more than just tolerated â€“ and at no point Bujold
goes for the easy way out. No good vs evil here, oh no, just heartbreak.
