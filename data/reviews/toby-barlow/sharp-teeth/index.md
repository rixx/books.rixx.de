Werewolf packs in LA might seem like an urban fantasy staple (and it is), but not like this: Toby Barlow tells the
brutal (but not edgy! never that) story of the werewolves and their surroundings in form of an epic, 300 page modern
poem.

The story itself is alright. We get the one pack, the other pack, the female wolves, the male wolves, cowardice and
pride, the adjacent cop – all a bit off the usual stereotypes. Not completely, but definitely enough to make it appear
fresh and real instad of a trope fest.
