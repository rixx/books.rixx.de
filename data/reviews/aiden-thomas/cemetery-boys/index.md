  tldr: Coming-of-age novel about a trans gay Latinx boy in the US, who fights to
    become a brujo and solve a mystery.  Well-done intersectional queer-by-default
    YA.

Coming-of-age novel set in an urban fantasy: Yadriel is a Latinx trans boy in the US. His whole family are brujx and
don't accept him as a brujo. Naturally, he spends the novel proving himself â€“ but with a fair bit of reflection and
friendships and non-transition related plot thrown in. Intersectional YA is pretty cool and all (most non-Latinx people
here are queer by default, delightfully), and my only issue with this was how predictable the plot is and how YA
possibly just isn't for me anymore.
