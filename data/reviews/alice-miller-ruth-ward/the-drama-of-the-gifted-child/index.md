Some self-help books are for a very specific audience. *The Drama of the Gifted Child* is one of those, and I am not its
audience. I buy the claim that children do a lot of things to fulfil expectations rather than out of their own desire,
but at least for me, this behaviour never reached the pathological levels that this book assumes as the baseline shared
experience.

It's short and polarises early, so it's definitely worth reading the first chapter to see if there's something here for
you.
