More from the ever-same dramatic duo with the uncomfortably unhealthy Ds overtones. An old enemy returns for lack of
interesting new ones, a new ally spawns in just to be hot and awesome. If not for the overly yikes and predictable
parts, I might be interested to see where the series goes after escalating towards the end, but I think I'll stop here.
