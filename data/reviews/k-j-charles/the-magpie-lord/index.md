Romance, mysterious curse, estate management: A queer/gay romance in a fantasy version of Victorian England.  The
youngest exiled son of a lord returns to England after his father and brother die, and has to contest with the curse
that led to their deaths. Luckily, he finds a strange but attractive young wizard blah blah blah, you see where this
ends.  Very atmospheric, and a bit too well-written to deserve to be labeled as "enjoyable trash".

There's a second part, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to read it.
