For the first part of the series, I called it “too well-written to deserve to be labeled as enjoyable trash”. The
language of this second part remains well done, but the *writing* … not as much. It's more over-the-top, tryhard – when
it doesn't really need to try hard, being itself would be enough: Magic Victorian lover boys return to the dirty city
and deal with giant rats and prejudice while alternating between horniness and relationship drama. It's not bad, but the
charm of the first part has worn off a bit. I'm not planning to read the next part any time soon, but I imagine at some
point I'll be sick or tired or just in need of a comfort read, and I'll come back to the series then.
