  tldr: I had not expected to find a perfect description of startup culture, but here
    we are. Very readable and clarified some terms, like reactionary vs conservative
    socialism.

Short, readable, to the point. The predictive parts were outdated shortly after publishing the manifesto, but the analytical parts were highly interesting and often spot on.

Reading this primary source corrected a couple of misunderstandings for me: I had laboured under an incorrect understanding of bourgeoisie, for example, which here is used to describe startup culture perfectly (honestly.)
There's also a section that draws a distinction between reactionary socialism and conservative socialism, which was helpful considering that I tend to use those terms interchangeably (and also mostly see them used that way).
