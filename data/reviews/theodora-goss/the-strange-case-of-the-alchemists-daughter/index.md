The Strange Case of the Alchemist's Daughter by *Theodora Goss* was an absolute delight. It takes place in Victorian
London, and we see the daughters of Dr Jekyll, Mr Hyde, Dr Moreau, and other classics of Victorian literature trying to
unravel the mystery of their creation (in absence of their creators, who mostly died gruesome deaths, perfectly
appropriate). It's a lovely book, perfectly well-written, utterly charming and entertaining, featuring a lot of
well-researched facts. References are abound. If this is not the age or type of literature you feel comfortable with, it
might not be the book for you, but otherwise, it's the very best of books for a relaxing read.
