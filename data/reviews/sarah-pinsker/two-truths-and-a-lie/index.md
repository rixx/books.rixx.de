Horror is not my genre, so I feel out of my depth in reviewing this story. It stuck with me, though â€“ I'm writing this
review nine months after I read it, and I still remember the story, the characters (the lying protagonist, the creepy
Uncle Bob of the even creepier TV show, and, oh dear, the hill).

I'm not the biggest short story person, so "it stuck with me" and "wtf was this trip" is honestly as much as I can hope
for. Not sure how she does it, but Pinsker's stories are just always so memorable.

The story is available online.
