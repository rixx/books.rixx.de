Magic born in the silent movies, or rather, in the people reading out the dialog cards in movie theatres. Creative, fun,
nice commentary on the power of language and editors (did Pinsker write this to appease her own editors? who knows). I'd
have rated it higher from other authors, probably, but my standards for Pinsker are unreasonably high. Still a neat
thing to read.
