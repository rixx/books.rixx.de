  tldr: Short story collection - two or three really worked for me, and you can't
    ask more than that from a story collection.

Sarah Pinsker writes excellent short stories. This collection opens with some shorter stories, which I found *too*
short: They ended before anything could happen, all just setting up a scenario, then leaving me hungry for *something*:

The man with the prosthetic arm that wants to be a road is *just that*. The rock star escaping a cruise ship in a
post-apocalyptic waste land is *just that*. The world where veterans willingly suppress their memory except during one
day a year, where they make policy decisions is *just that*. The artificial grandmother gets a tiny, tiny development.
The haunted houses that simulate people's identities could be so strong, but I felt like the twist cheapened the story.
The dying architect's family felt very real and touching, but again the ending was â€¦ ehhhh. The sirens that didn't know
what to do with the intersex protagonist: good idea, strong (oppressive) world description, but again ehh on the arc.

Luckily, this collection also includes her longer shorts, including two I knew already: the good [Wind Will
Rove](https://books.rixx.de/sarah-pinsker/wind-will-rove/) and the excellent [And Then There Were
(N-One)](https://books.rixx.de/sarah-pinsker/and-then-there-were-n-one/), which I cannot recommend enough (and which is
also available stand-alone). Additionally, there was a story about one of the last touring bands in a world where
holo live entertainment is everywhere, which was vivid and American (of the road-trip variety, of course) and strong.
