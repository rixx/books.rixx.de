Twitter literature!  Black Box by *Jennifer Egan* is a neat experiment â€“ a story that was tweeted out, back in the old
days, when Twitter was still at 140 characters. I found the distinctive style and the rhythm of the tweet boundaries
interesting, and the primary storytelling device if not brilliant, then at least refreshing.
