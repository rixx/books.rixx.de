  tldr: Enjoyable second part of the series. Generally better than the first part,
    except for the sheer stupidity of the ending (which serves to set up a lot of
    equally stupid drama.)

Enjoyable second part of the series: Our heroes encounter adversity and have to make bad choices and live with their
decisions. Less comfort read than the first part, different and good. The ending is extremely stupid and sets up the
exceedingly stupid cause for the drama causing part three and four.
