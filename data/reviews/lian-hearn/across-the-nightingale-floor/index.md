  tldr: Village boy into clan lord and assassin in Fantasy faux-Japan. Good fun, if
    bloody.

Everybody is extremely dramatic in this book. Very YA. But it stood up to a re-read surprisingly well: Young boy in
faux-Japan gets his family murdered, is adopted into a clan and things escalate from there. Oh, and it turns out he's
not only adopted by the rightful leader of the clan, he's also born to a long line of secret assassins and has lots of
magical gifts. And everybody wants a piece of them.

It's fairly brutal and bloody, and the story is a bit predictable and sometimes makes characters stupid for a minute to
further its aims. But it's still fun to read.
