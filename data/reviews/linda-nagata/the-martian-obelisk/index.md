I felt like **The Martian Obelisk** by *Linda Nagata* only built despair to alleviate it, and that was about it. I think
the reason is that I don't buy an Earth with reduced but still significant population levels and significant
infrastructure mixed with sentences like "surgery became a lost art" and the debilitating despair that seemed to stop
everybody from doing anything actually useful.
