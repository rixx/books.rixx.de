I am into linguistics sci-fi, and it was in search of more of it that I read this book. Or, at least, tried to
read it: I gave up about 60% in, and it didn't work for me at all. First Contact, dodgy language experiments on kids,
just as dodgy writing, some rainforest activism, plus no women (released in 1973, and I know for a fact that there were
women on Earth even back then), â€¦  there was nothing to keep me going.
