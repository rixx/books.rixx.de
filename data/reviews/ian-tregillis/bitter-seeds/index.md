  tldr: Nazis with supermen vs British war mages, winning the contest for flattest
    and most icky characters this year. Blech.

Nazis, but they have supermen, vs British war mages who will gladly sacrifice children. Unpleasant all around. Nobody is
sympathetic, nobody is even interesting, everybody is terrible, and I haven't met flatter characters in ages. Didn't
enjoy anything about it.
