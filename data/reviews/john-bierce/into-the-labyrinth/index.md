Magic school fantasy, including a sentient library, actual magic with actual learning, and a misfit band of three
friends, standing up to the bullies. It's post-Harry-Potter and it shows, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Compared with Harry Potter, it has better characters (a protagonist with an actual characters, Side kicks whose
backstories matter for more than just backdrop), on-par worldbuilding (less detail, but a semblance of a magic system
and a sentient library), a worse plot and worse writing. Yeah, I know, that's impressive, but what can you do.

It's a good easy comfort read, and did I mention the sentient library?
