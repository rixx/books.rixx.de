Isn't it weird how fanfics often are obsessed with presents that characters give one another? It's as if the author yells
"birthday o'clock motherfuckers" and has to follow up with a list of presents, and then, of course, also fit all of the
presents into the future storyline. I call it Pavlov-Chekhov's Present. It's obnoxious and one of the things that makes
the Mage Errant books read like fanfic, and great passages to illustrate how the writing could be so much more.

Anyways. Young mages learn magic and solve problems way above their weight class, part 3. It's not bad, just cheap.
