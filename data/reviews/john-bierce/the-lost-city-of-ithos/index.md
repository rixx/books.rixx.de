  tldr: Currently the last part of the Mage Errant series. Setting up to drag the
    whole thing out, in that Fantasy spiral of upping the stakes forever. Characters
    still okay, plot very generic..

Currently the last part of the Mage Errant series, I was not all that much in love with this book. It's the set-up to
drag the whole series out, in that Fantasy spiral of upping the stakes forever. Characters were still okay (though
mostly carried by the work of the previous parts), but the plot turned very generic..
