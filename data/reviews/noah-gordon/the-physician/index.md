One of my earliest historical fiction books, and I loved it to pieces. It seemed so real, and so unflinching, and I
dreamt about it a lot. Now I know that in many ways, it follows genre conventions and Gordon's research is … middling
and in the service of drama. Oh well – I can't ask for more than enjoyment at the time of reading.

Interestingly, [his Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Gordon_(novelist)) mentions that Gordon is much
better known in Germany and Spain than in his native USA.
