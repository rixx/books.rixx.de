Centuries after the first volume, the Cole family is still going strong as physicians. But how do you deal with the
deafness of your oldest son if healing is your complete identity? Not particularly well, it turns out. There's a lot of
room for personal growth and it is used very well. I also had the impression that the research was better (possibly
because as a US American writer, Gordon is closer to the topic).
