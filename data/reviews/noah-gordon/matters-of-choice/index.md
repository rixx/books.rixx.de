Bringing the saga of the Cole family physicians to an end, we see a daughter of the family make her way through modern
medicine. She decides against a soulless research jobs and becomes a country doctor. She deals with the difficulties
that good doctors always find: Abuse, abortions, euthanasia, poverty. It's not my favourite part of the series, but I
thought it was handled well at the time.
