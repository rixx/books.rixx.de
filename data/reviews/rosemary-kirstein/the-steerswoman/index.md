  tldr: I found my way back to real books, and what a relief! Excellent characters
    and worldbuilding, an eye for details, okay plot. Loved the mostly-female order
    of scientific truth seekers in a Fantasy world.

Gooood Fantasy! Highly likable characters, good world, good plot, excellent eye for detail. The concept of a
mostly-female order/guild/group of scientifically minded truth seekers is very cool, and yet not overdone.  Science
Fantasy in an NK Jemisin way. Way to go on the emancipation side: women being equal to men is just a non-issue in all
jobs (guards, merchants, sailors, etc).

If I had read this a couple of years ago, I might have been less susceptible to HPMOR.
