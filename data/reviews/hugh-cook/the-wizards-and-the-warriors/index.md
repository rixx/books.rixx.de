  tldr: Much less generic than the title makes it sound, but didn't really work for
    me regardless. Felt like ASOIAF x Malazan.

Some wizards try to re-capture an artifact that could end the world, but get caught up in wars, petty conflicts, their
own desires, centuries-old curses, the works. This book is *much* less generic than both the title and this summary make
it sound. A lot about it is unique – like [A Song of Ice and Fire](/george-r-r-martin/a-game-of-thrones/) crossed
with [Malazan](/steven-erikson/gardens-of-the-moon).

This feeling comes from two things: The characters have unique (or at least unusual) profiles despite their flatness,
and their one or two adjectives drive the plot more than anything else. And: the plot is full of twists and doesn't
follow tropes (or jumps from trope to trope so fast that it nearly doesn't matter).

This book didn't really work for me – everything is very "this thing happens, then the next thing happens", and as with
Malazan, it's very much a window into a huge world. Either you get into the world (read all the books, make all the
connections), or it will always be part of a bigger picture that you miss.
