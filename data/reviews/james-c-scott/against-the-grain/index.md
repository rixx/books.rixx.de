Impressive and intriguing: *Against the Grain* tells the story of early state-building as a story of agriculture –
that's not new. What's new is that James Scott has spent years aggregating the current insights of history and
archaeology to paint the same idea from a new angle: What if early states did not naturally arise with the cultivation
of grain – what if they *required* a food staple as grain (divisible, countable, and with a strict yearly cycle) to
establish a bureaucracy?

Scott poses that living within a state was, contrary to popular impressions, not actually good for its people. Working a
field and then losing parts of your crop to the state, and another to non-state raids, was vastly more work than using
various food sources as non-state people did. He traces the cultivation of grain, the invention of writing, and
especially the meaning of the various "dark ages" and "collapses". I don't completely buy his lens, but it's a good lens
regardless: not only for how it changes my perception of state structures, but also how it gives me access to an
interesting angle for all kinds of human communities.

That said: while every single paragraph is insightful and every single chapter has its place, the book *still* manages
to feel like a giant slog, and at some point just … ends? I would have liked an actual ending and was a bit
perplexed. I'm now very motivated to read *Seeing Like a State*, Scott's most popular work, … next year, perhaps.
