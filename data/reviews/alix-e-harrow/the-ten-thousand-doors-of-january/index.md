  tldr: Coming-of-age portal fantasy. Nice, but not my cup of tea.

Coming-of-age stories are possibly just not for me anymore. The book-driven portal fantasy is nice enough, and the
helping of "remember how bad turn-of-the-century racism is" is not bad if a bit forced, but … I just didn't care about
the predictable story. If only there had been a bigger focus on the portals, or the portal writing, or the
portal worlds …  I can appreciate why this book is popular, but it felt more generic than it should have to
me.
