The Phoenix Project is a very nice management introduction for IT projects, talking about ITIL, about processes and
about Agile Methods.

It's only very basically made up to seem like a novel instead of a textbook, but if you accept it as such (a very
entertaining textbook instead of a novel), it works fairly well if you don't mind the incessant preaching. (I do mind)

Also, the depiction of what can, must and will go wrong in IT Operations is just so spot on it might hurt.
