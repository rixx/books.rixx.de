Sometimes, you find books that are good books, and you notice how they are good books, and you like the parts that make
them good books, but you don't like them. **Station Eleven** by *Emily St. John Mandel* is such a book for me. It's not
the characters – they are vivid, and real, and neither horrible nor brilliant people. It's not the plot – the story
wanders, and is mostly slice-of-apocalyptic-life, but it's a good story. It's not the writing – the language is
precise and beautiful and conjures up images and feelings in your mind.

Reading this book while depressed is not a good idea. And don't get me wrong, it's not the post-apocalyptic parts that
are bad. It's the parts that play in our world, where everything is still working, where no plague has yet devoured
humanity. Those parts hooked me, the way a fish is hooked, and then caught, and then consequently gutted.
