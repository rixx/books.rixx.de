Other than 1984, this one goes a bit more into the rise of dictatorships and how coercion and decisionmaking works.
Same as 1984, it's flat and punches you in the face repeatedly, lest you miss the point. The point is also written in
large capital letters all across the book, in case you manage to miss the punches.
