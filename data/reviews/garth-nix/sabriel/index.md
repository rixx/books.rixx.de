I really really liked this book. It's very solid fantasy, it has its own plot, its characters are wonderful and not
cliche and I very much want to read more of this. Sabriel as the new Abhorsen was a joy. One point less than perfect
because … well, it does not feel quite perfect. Minor inconsistencies in language, some lazy plot points … but still.
It's a really, really good fantasy book.
