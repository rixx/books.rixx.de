Here ends the story â€“ and by the time the ending came, I wasn't all that invested in the world anymore. It was
interesting, it was dramatic, but it was far from life-changing. Much of it seemed more of an intellectual exercise to
me: How will she wrap things up, who is going to live? And after getting answers, I closed that chapter of my reading
life. The excitement had been long gone.
