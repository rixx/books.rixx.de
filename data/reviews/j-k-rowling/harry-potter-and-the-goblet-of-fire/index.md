This was the first Harry Potter book that I read while it was still new. That was a novel experience for me:
Most of my books up to that point had been old, or at least definitely not new. Reading an ongoing series was
exciting. I don't remember much speculation about what would happen next, except for some recurring "Is Snape good or
evil" debate.

Anyways, I enjoyed the Goblet of Fire stuff. It was suitably magical, and felt like it definitely needed to be in a
movie â€“ it was much more action-focused and scene-driven than the previous parts.
