Meh. I kind of expected more (in volume, at least), and the Dumbledore parts reminded me awfully of Kästner in Pünktchen
&amp; Anton, where he felt the need to explain lots of stuff, especially the political implications. I think Rowling
might have done better to trust her readers to think for themselves.
