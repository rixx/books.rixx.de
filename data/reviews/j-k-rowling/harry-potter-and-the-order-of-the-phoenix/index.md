My low point of the series. I remember getting this book, at a midnight release party, and then reading it within the
next day. I wasn't immediately disappointed, but I hated the whole "teenager yells at cloud" thing, and while Umbridge
was delightfully evil, I just wasn't on board with the weird plot shape and the growing pains.
