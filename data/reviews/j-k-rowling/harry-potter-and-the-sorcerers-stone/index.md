  text: If you like the angle of young disadvantaged kids getting to do magic in a
    realistic world, I will not stop recommending the Young Wizards series. It does
    so many things so much better than Harry Potter – it comes at it from a more grounded,
    more realistic view, and carries it off extremely well. It helps that Diane Duane
    is also a better writer if you just compare their prose.

Harry Potter – look, I can't be objective. I grew up on these books. My friends and I could act out entire scenes by
heart. I went through the cycle a generation experienced: Love, obsession, disappointment (to varying degrees, mine was
fairly light), detachment (in many cases by growing up, in my case by discovering fanfics).

I still really like the first book though. It has a strong vibe of a good book for kids, strong worldbuilding, an
atmosphere you can nearly touch. I don't mind its inconsistencies, the lack of logic in many places. It mirrors how a
child sees the world: when I read the books as a kid, there was nothing weird about Harry being abandoned on a doorstep
by supposedly-responsible adults and then tortured for much of his life. I mean, relatable content, right?

In some ways, the series as a whole is a mess, and that's not talking about the aggressive retconning business the
author has tacked on on Twitter in the years after publishing it. But I still enjoy revisiting the feeling I got when I
read the books, and that's really all that matters.

## Further Reading

And then, of course, there is fanfiction. I have not added all the Harry Potter fanfiction I've read to this site, but
I've added notable ones, and you can find them [here](/lists/fanfic).
