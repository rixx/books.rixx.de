There's nothing left to be said about Harry Potter books. This was the first one that felt like Harry was changing,
growing up, getting some kind of agency.  The whole book felt like autumn, with the smell of wet leaves clinging to
everything.  Naturally I liked the whole "finding a new home" arc. And, equally naturally, I felt very seen in the plot
arc that introduces time travel for the primary purpose of reading more books and learning more things. This might be my
favourite part of the series (either this one or the first).
