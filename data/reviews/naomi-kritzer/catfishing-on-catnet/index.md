Catfishing on CatNet was tons of fun. It's a not-quite-light YA about a helpful AI who just wants to look at cat
pictures and also help their friends. In a way it's the YA version of MurderBot. It includes some heavy themes, and they
are generally handled well. Kritzer has a really good grip on chatroom language and managed to write all those parts
good without "hello, fellow kids" vibes, which I appreciated a lot.
