HPMOR is both the best and the worst of rationalist fiction. Terrible, terrible writing, in a physically painful stilted
style, and oh-so-fucking superior. There aren't even characters in this story, only symbols.

At the same time, there's the sequence against death, which I kind of love to pieces, enough to revisit it occasionally.
