Reading Crusoe as a 12-year-old is not exactly the best experience. Possibly the translation's fault, granted â€“ but
nevertheless, I never felt like returning to this overly ornate writing of a rather dull story. I know, I know! It's
written in 1719, it's by some standards the first novel, all that. Doesn't mean it's enjoyable, and particularly the
religious bent is positively Narnian.
