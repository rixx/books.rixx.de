Extremely strong, vivid story. I'm left with a lot of impressions â€“ because the worldbuilding was good, because the
characters were strong, because the story was better than decent. A couple of minor points like a predictable staple
plot twist or sudden relationship building dialogues while in a dangerous situation didn't detract from my enjoyment.
The first book in a long time that led to me just devouring it.
