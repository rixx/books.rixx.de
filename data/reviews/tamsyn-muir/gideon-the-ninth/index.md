  tldr: Hm. The first third was slow and muddled, and while it got MUCH better, it
    feels like Grimdark Flippant Protagonist no 23 has been done to death. It's a
    good setting, but setting isn't everything.

Gideon the Ninth is popular, but didn't work for me â€“ the first third (or so) felt very muddled and I was
wondering why everybody seemed to love this book so much. It got better, but the world it played in never felt quite
solid to me, and I'd have liked it much more with just a bit less flippancy? Grimdark with aggressively flippant
protagonist has been done to death. Quality of writing and worldbuilding increased throughout the book, apart from the
final battle, and I enjoyed how the characters were fleshed out (for most of them, at least).
