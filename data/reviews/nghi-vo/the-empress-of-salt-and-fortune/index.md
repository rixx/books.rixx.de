  tldr: In a Chinese-inspired Fantasy world, a young monk (an enby, as monks are in
    this world) chronicles the dead Empress's life story by searching her old castle.
    Neat novella.

High fantasy novella, vaguely Chinese-plus-Inuit (shush, it makes sense). After the Empress has died, a young monk
– monks are enby in this world, which is neat – travels to her old castle, that has been off limits for decades. They
explore the house and chronicle the stories of various things they find. It turns out to be vastly different than
expected.

The storytelling is often subtle – blink, and you'll miss a point. The more important something is, the less time is
spent on it, just like you would avoid painful but obvious past events in your conversations with friends. It's rather
short, but tells its story well, and only gets better as the story progresses.
