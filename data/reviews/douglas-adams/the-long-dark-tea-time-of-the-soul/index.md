Fun ride, but not outstanding. I liked the gods, the absurdness, and – for some reason – the protagonist. Slightly
annoyed with featureless female sidekicks, but what can you do. I have on occasion had the uncharitable thought that the
title might be better than the book. It's not, but it's also not not.
