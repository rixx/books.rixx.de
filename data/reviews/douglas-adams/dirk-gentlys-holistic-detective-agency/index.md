Inevitably, the Dirk Gently books get compared to the Hitchhiker's Guide books. Lacking originality, I'll do the same.
Yes, this book is much denser and a bit more absurd despite the fact that the Earth remains standing (er, revolving) and
there are no aliens. It also feels more geeky, or nerdy, or written to a British academic in-group. Or possibly against it.
