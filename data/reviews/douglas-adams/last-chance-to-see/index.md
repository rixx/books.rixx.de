  text: This is the closest in Adams's fiction writing, I think. It has a similar
    melancholy note that absolutely refuses to be sad, and will joke about itself
    until the end.

Douglas Adams presents: Humans destroying the Earth (for a change). As fun as a book on this topic can be.
Well-informed, well-researched, well-written.
