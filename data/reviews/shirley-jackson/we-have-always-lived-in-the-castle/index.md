We Have Always Lived in the Castle by *Shirley Jackson* is very "what did I just read"? It's a weird horror short story, in a way, that makes vrey good use of the first-person narrator. Soft and slow horror, coupled with very good information revelations by implication, and use of very Gaiman/Rothfuss-like thinking about magic. I can't even talk about the setting too much without spoiling the wonderfully slow storytelling, but I can tell you this: While it wasn't for me, I know many people who loved this story very much, and I get why. If you liked The Ocean at the End of the Lane for it's horror aspects, this book might very well be great for you.
