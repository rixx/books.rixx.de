  tldr: Walter Moers connects 21 illustrations by Gustave Doré in a delightfully weird
    story
---

Walter Moers decided to branch out and do something wildly different. Okay, maybe not wildly: there's still much
absurdity going on. But it's not Zamonien. Instead, it's the story of Gustave Doré, the famous painter. Or rather, his
paintings. Or rather, all of his paintings, shoved together into a rather trippy (but entertaining!) story.

It's not exactly great art, but it's a great art exercise. And it might be the best German writing I've read in a long
time – Moers really is a brilliant author. Some of the puns are so deeply embedded that you can't even hope to translate
them.

It may be the only Moers book without Moers illustrations, which is sad. But I guess if you can't have Moers, Doré will
do.
