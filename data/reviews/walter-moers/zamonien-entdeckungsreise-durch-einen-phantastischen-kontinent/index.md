Even though I love the Zamonien books as much as anybody, this … was not it. This book is an encyclopaedia for the
fictional continent Zamonien, as a tie-in for all the other books by [Walter
Moers](https://books.rixx.de/walter-moers/). And I understand everybody who loved it, in a nostalgic way, thinking back
to when they first read the Zamonion books. But damn, this feels so limited, like a big missed chance.

The book is a mix of small illustrations, book quotes and summaries of book events/people/places. There is very little
(if any?) new material. It's just a refresher, without substance of its own. Compare it to a very similar book about
[Harry Potter](https://www.amazon.de/Das-rund-Harry-Potter-Lexikon/dp/3896022806), which was an important part of my
childhood: It provided plenty of information that wasn't to be found in the books, both real history (mostly about
ancient and medieval superstitions) and in-universe characters (probably drawn from author interviews). Additionally, it
strictly kept to the tone of a serious encyclopaedia, which was both fun and impressive. This book neither provides lots
of new material nor embraces the style – even though it would've been so tempting to refer to the in-universe
encyclopaedia! Sad to see another middling book reaping the profits of the earlier brilliant work.
