This is where Moers proved he was a wizard. It's not his best book, but it's absolutely outstanding nevertheless. The
tour through the 13½ lives of Cpt Bluebear is amazing, astounding, sparkling with fantastic ideas as if it had been
written by 13 creative geniuses instead of just one.

It's a good book is what I'm saying.
