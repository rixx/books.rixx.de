More Victorian urban history queer romance with an aristocrat with evil family and a lower-class magician â€“ please
somebody tell my why this is such a huge thing. I could do without the repetitiveness and the everything while just
enjoying parts of the setting.

Anyways, Lord Whatshisname is magically trapped at home by his evil father, on the pretext of his scandalous behaviour,
until he consents to marry. Young gay magician with a skill of talking to inanimate objects happens by, starts helping,
and everything escalates until the two are together and discover Lord Whatty's true nature. Blah. Writing was alright,
and it wasn't terrible as far as popcorn reads go, but it wasn't very good, either, and I feel no need to continue
reading the series.
