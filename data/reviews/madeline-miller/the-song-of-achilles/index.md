  tldr: Basically Achilles fanfiction. A bit better than I make it sound but not *that*
    much better. Reading this so soon after War Music was not a good idea.

Circe was okayish, this is the second chance I was giving Miller before deciding that her access to myths doesn't match
mine. I liked Achilles more than Circe, but part of that is that I'm a sucker for the pairing. I didn't like the
depiction of Patroclus too much, and both felt oddly pale to me. I know it's the current poster child of queer
readership and TikTok in particular, but â€¦ ehh. It's alright.

Could be I'm just unfairly harsh because Logue's War Music has set unreasonable standards, though.
