The Family Trade introduces the Merchant Princess worlds (all three of them) and takes us along with Miriam in
discovering the mechanics (mostly economical mechanics) of those worlds. Solid world building, this is probably hard
economic science fiction. Not my main area of interest but apart from some passages on trading that became too in-detail
for me, I enjoyed the book.
