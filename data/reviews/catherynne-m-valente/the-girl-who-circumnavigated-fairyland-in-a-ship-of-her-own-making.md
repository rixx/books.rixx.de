This is a very nice little book, filled with Faerie and language that is exceedingly ornate but never quite pretentious.
And it's a modern fairy tale at that - September, the protagonist, didn't grow too close to my heart, but the narrator
did, and that is good enough.

## Further Reading

[Alice](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2004/alice-in-wonderland) would be the obvious recommendation for a girl dealing
with nonsensically fantastic worlds on her own, but I don't actually think the books share anything except superficial
points.

If you like the portal aspect, consider looking into the [Wayward Children
books](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2018/every-heart-a-doorway). If you liked the heroine most of all, take a look at
[Coraline](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2003/coraline), if you dare.
