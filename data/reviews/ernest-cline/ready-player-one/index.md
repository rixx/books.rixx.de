I liked Ready Player One (and remember, three stars means 'liked it', not 'meh').

It immerses you in a dystopic future where humanity takes to a huge Virtual Reality to flee their problems (dwindling
oil reserves mean poverty, starvation, slums everywhere). We join a young protagonist on his quest for the hugest
in-game Easteregg ever.

Its flaws lie mostly within its highly predictable storyline: [spoilers removed] Urgh.

Also, logical flaws: Not using proper data science and cross-referencing to solve riddles? Please, that's what every
mega-corp would do! There are some instances of less-well thought out behavior like that, sometimes breaking the
immersion for me.

But apart from the boring overall plot, this book shines with creativity and a huge lot of 80s culture. Loved
the references, loved the attention to detail[spoilers removed].

It's a feel-good book: A simple, predictable plot with lots of love to detail, enough sophistication in
characters so that you actually want the good guys to win[spoilers removed].
