Funny story, actually: I had to give a presentation about Anna Karenina in school, and since the book was so terribly
long, I did it entirely from online sources (and got the highest possible grade). But while looking for the passage I
wanted to read out loud, I discovered that the book was super readable and so I read it â€¦ after the presentation.
