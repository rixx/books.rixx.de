Sherlock Holmes, just German and in the 1920s. If that sounds exciting to you, uh, here you go? I'm not kidding it's
really straight up Sherlock, just in Cologne. There's a Mrs Hudson, the story is told from the point of view of his
flatmate, a doctor returned from the army in the colonies, and they live together amid disputes about substance abuse in
No 21B. Sherlock is talking incessantly about shoe soles instead of cigarette ashes, and they have to deal with a
well-meaning but obviously wrong police officer, who invites them to the case only to not listen to them.
