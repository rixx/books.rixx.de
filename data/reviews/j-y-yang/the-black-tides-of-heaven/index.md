  tldr: Asian-inspired genderfun fantasy. Not compelling to me, but not terrible either.

Asian-inspired genderfun fantasy. Didn't compel me at all: the plot wasn't as focused as the short length warranted, and
the characters didn't stand out to me at all. The plot was compressed and considering the high odds and tragedy, didn't
make me care at all.

One well-done thing was how this society allows children to choose their gender after growing up gender-neutral, and the
protagonist's way to his gender is well-written, and not made a focus after that arc is finished.
