Unconvincing first-contact fiction. The protagonist is the daughter of quasi-Assange, and lives in poverty due to his
actions after the divorce from her mother. It's all pretty grim, and then the aliens land. For semi-random reasons, one
of them picks her as its translator – nothing to do with her skill or anything, and the fact that she has studied
linguistics has nothing to do with anything.

Some details stand out as good, but generally nothing convinced me. The writing quality is at decent web-serial/fanfic
levels, which is not unreadable, but also nothing that entices me to read more. The aliens are always emphasised to be
very alien and that anthromorphising them is useless … but nevertheless, the book proceeds to do just that left and
right. There are some rare intentional parts, but mostly it's just thoughtless storytelling. Cora is meant to be
relatable, but feels hollow. The eventual <span class="spoilers">interspecies romance</span> felt inevitable and
uninteresting.

Just didn't work for me, all things considered.
