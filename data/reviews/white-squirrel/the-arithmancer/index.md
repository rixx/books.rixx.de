  tldr: Decent Harry Potter fanfic whith Hermione as math genius. Rat adjacent but
    nowhere near the mess that is HPMOR. Imagine having actual characters *and* science,
    at the same time.

Honestly decent Harry Potter fanfic: Hermione starts out a math genius and things escalate. Good writing, a bunch of
very thoughtful world-building. Close to canon without being stupid or pretentious. Delightfully nerdy, good research.
Overdoing the canon in places, I think, and also the meta fandom commentary (but not often and not obnoxiously).
