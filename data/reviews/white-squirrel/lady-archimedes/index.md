  tldr: Second part of the fanfic series. Better plot, worse writing, and gets an
    honourable mention for having a bibliography that includes Heinlein, Sagan, Niven
    and Tolkien.

Second part of a Harry Potter fanfic. Better plot elements, maybe, but worse writing – started being a drag at some
point. Still good execution on the theme of "what if science nerd, but Hermione" – several leagues more plausible and
readable than HPMOR. I still like how it quotes extensively from pop and less-pop culture, and how it integrates
then-current events.

## Bibliography

- Heinlein: The Moon is a Harsh Mistress
- Sagan: Pale Blue Dot
- Niven: Ringworld
