Second part of a Harry Potter fanfic. Better plot elements, maybe, but worse writing – started being a drag at some
point. Still good execution on the theme of "what if science nerd, but Hermione" – several leagues more plausible and
readable than HPMOR. I still like how it quotes extensively from pop and less-pop culture, and how it integrates
then-current events.

## Bibliography
