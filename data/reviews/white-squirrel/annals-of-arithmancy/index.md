  tldr: Conclusion to the fanfic trilogy. Contained the quote "The extinction of the
    human race will come from its inability to emotionally comprehend the exponential
    function." – hitting a bit hard right now.

Last part of the trilogy. Not *bad* per se, but far from good. A collection of "look where I could take this" stories,
loosely connected. No urgency or impact, really. Better than the original epilogue, but what isn't.
