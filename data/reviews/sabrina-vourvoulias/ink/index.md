Ink by *Sabrina Vourvoulias* is okay urban dystopic fantasy with a critical stance towards important issues within the
US, mostly concerning latinx population and immigration. It touches on these issues beautifully, but came off a bit
heavy-handed in many regards â€“ people felt magical, yet one-dimensional. It may just be that I'm at least one major
ocean and culture shift removed from the intended audience, though.
