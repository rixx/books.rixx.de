Monstrous Regiment is not one of the best Discworld books, I'd argue. It shows Pratchett's personal politics a bit more
than some, and its final character arc is so cheesy it's downright embarassing.

That said, it stands among my five-star books because it was (and possibly is) tremendously important to me and I can't
get it out of my head. Also, props for accurate depiction of what eastern Europe feels like, sometimes.
