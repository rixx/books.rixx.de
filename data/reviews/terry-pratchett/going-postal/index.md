The post office story about innovation and all sorts of things was a bit too on-the-nose allegorical for my tastes
(though I liked Thud!, so I really shouldn't complain I suppose). As an ardent Miles Vorkosigan fan, I loved the
momentum, but didn't get on with the protagonist. This might've been a three-star book, but was saved by Vetinari.
