By a wide margin the earliest Pratchett book that I can give five stars. It's still part of his silly phase, and it
predates Night Watch by eleven years, but there's a hard core, flinty and unwavering and willing to punch you in the
feelings. In particular, it punched feelings I needed punched. Compared to later Witches books, the whole "people don't
always want what they need" arc is soft and fluffy, of course, and it's not what drew me. No: what's stuck in my head is
the final scene in the mirror, with Granny and her sister. It's powerful and I'm happy to ignore a book full of Oz
references to get there.
