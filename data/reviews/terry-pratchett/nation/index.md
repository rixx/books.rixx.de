Nation is amazing. Non-Discworld, YA-ish story of a Victorian girl meeting a boy from an islander tribe â€“ she strands,
his tribe is wiped out by the same tidal wave. As you'd expect from Pratchett, he thoroughly does away with any notions
of civilisation and superiority. Not as over-the-top as Discworld, while still retaining Pratchett charme, which makes
it more touching and raw and real.

Great way to have people read Pratchett who bounced off the more forced silliness of Discworld, and don't like Victorian
fanboying.
