Pratchett would have laughed to hear (or so I like to imagine) that 14-year-old me actually *learned* all the
rock'n'roll stereotypes from this book. It's a weird introduction to this part of pop culture, but it could be so much
worse.

This is also the first Discworld book that I read in English (after reading it in German first). It was a fascinating
comparison and gave me a good feeling for how much longer I had to work on my English until I could read Discworld
entirely in English.
