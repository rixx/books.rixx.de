Easily the best Watch book, and up among my favourite Pratchett books. Vimes goes back in time, now that he has cleaned
up his act (somewhat), and meats Young Vimes. There's a lot about growing up, and a lot about growing old, and some
things about revolutions and principles and not killing the people who try to kill you. Something something more
civilised age?
