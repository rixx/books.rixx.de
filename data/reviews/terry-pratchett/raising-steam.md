This … is not it. I wasn't into this Discworld arc to begin with, to be entirely fair – but even for that, this book
felt off. The rhythm is changed. It's less ready to cut you open and make you like it. At the same time, it's not early
Pratchett style, either.

I think I'm less disturbed by the change in rhythm and more disturbed at how little this book hurt. Because there's a
lot of potential in the story for very real pain, and yet it doesn't hurt. I mean, it does, of course: on a meta-level,
because we all suspect that this is due to Pratchett's illness and we don't want to live in a world where that's true.
