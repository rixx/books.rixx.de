This one is short and nice (well, no. Not nice, but if you know Punch and Judy shows, you'll enjoy it). Available online for free on lspace: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lspace.org/books/toc/toc-english.html#fn1" rel="nofollow">http://www.lspace.org/books/toc/toc-e...</a>.

Read more Pratchett, yo.
