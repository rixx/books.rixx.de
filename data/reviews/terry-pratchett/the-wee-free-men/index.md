This may well be the high point of the series, at least looking at it chronologically: Wee Free Men (introducing
Tiffany) and Night Watch (hands-down the best Watch book) were released back-to-back, and mark a departure from
jokes-first Pratchett to the writer who will hurt you and incidentally also make you laugh.
