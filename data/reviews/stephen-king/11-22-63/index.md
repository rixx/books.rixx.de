I found **11/22/63** a good time travel story (Would you give five years of your life to stop the JFK
assassination, given the chance?). *Stephen King*, as always, excells at the depiction of real, gritty human life with
all its ups and downs. I really think he can write about anything, natural or supernatural, as long as it has at least a
tenuous connection to Maine. The story had internal consistency, a bit of character development (with a not all that
clever protagonist, which I appreciated – not all protagonists need to be the cleverererest), and a satisfying
conclusion. Readers of It will appreciate the tie-ins, and I caught whiffs of the Dark Tower aesthetic and resonating
themes. The quality of writing is, as always with King, good: believable characters, mostly even with more than one
dimension, tight writing, the usual brilliant use of foreshadowing and -telling.

At the same time, there are definitely things that weren't good: First off, this is a slow book. It's not really about
the Kennedy assassination, or about time travel, it's mostly about the late 50s in America, in a very yearning, positive
tint. This did work for me, because I know little about the 50s in the US, and I can deal with slow books as long as
they are written well. But the rose-colored glasses in combination with a very pro-50s protagonist were a bit weird.
About at the time when I wanted to say "bullshit, the 50s in the US must have sucked!", King starts to talk about racism
for a bit – only to mostly abandon the topic afterwards. It's sometimes there on the sidelines, but only when King wants
to highlight that not *quite* everything was good back then.  Also, if you like Alternative History fiction: this is not
a book for you, there is no exploration of the actual consequences of different ways history might take.
