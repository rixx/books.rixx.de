So, thriller is most definitely not my genre, but I can't deny that Stephen King is a master - both in his genre and
with words in general. He paints incredibly vivid people, murdering for reasons they think right, and dealing with the
consequences.

While I'm still not into thrillers, I can't deny the pull these stories have, and I'm sure I'll try a full-length King
novel in the future.
