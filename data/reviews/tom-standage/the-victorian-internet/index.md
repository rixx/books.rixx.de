My first non-fiction book in quite some time, **The Victorian Internet** is a nice introduction into the rise and fall
of the electrical telegraph, and all its implications. *Tom Standage* shows us in an easy, meandering style how the
world changed due to the telegraph, and how people changed (and/or didn't). While he's often very direct (or on the
nose) about his theories, and some minor facts looked not quite well researched (Karlsruhe was never part of Prussia,
thank you very much), I liked both the very human approach to history, and his final – if simplistic – comparison
between telegraph an internet evolution.
