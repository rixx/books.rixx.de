A Lord Peter Wimsey mystery about lesbians, mostly. The mystery itself wasn't very compelling, with a solution so obvious I kept expecting a twist. The lesbian couples were a nice touch, though applied with their fair share of misogyny. Then there's the racism, which â€¦ could've been worse, I guess? Is implicitly criticised, vaguely? There were some pretty good characters to this book, but not much else.
