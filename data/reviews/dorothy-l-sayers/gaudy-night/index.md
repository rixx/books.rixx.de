  tldr: Objectively, this book is around 3.5-4 stars, but the romance broke my heart
    and the banter moved me to tears. 5/5, and I probably won't shut up about this
    one for a while.

Gaudy Night is the first book on my Wimsey re-read that I hadn't read before. In truth, it's about 3.5-4 stars, but it
gets five for breaking my heart.

The first half of this book – written centered on Harriet and her old college, is slow and terribly annoying, though not
without charm. Harriet is given to judging people from the outside, and commenting excessively on choice of dress and
attractiveness in general. She comes across, not without reason, as narrow-minded and uptight. The other
annoying-and-fascinating part is the sexism, sexism everywhere! Sometimes it's the subject of Sayers' point and
commentary (implicit and explicit), but sometimes it's just … there.

Then Lord Peter swoops in and saves Harriet. Not literally, though that happens too, but he saves the book, and her
character, and everything is just wonderful.

The mystery itself, as usually, is nothing to write home about, but the *setting*, oh!, the setting. It's lovely and
heart-breakingly well-written. As are the characters, even when they are annoying, and the banter, and long-budding
romance. In the first half I didn't understand why people would put it up there with Nine Tailors because it was clearly
worse, and the second half more than changed my opinion.
