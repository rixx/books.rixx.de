Sadly disappointing: Only the second book in a series that is currently up to eleven books and countless novellas, and
it already feels like the series is out of ideas and just mushing things together. There are regular excursions (Jack
the Ripper as weird monster hybrid in need of getting shot repeatedly), there are the enemies-in-time, there is the
protagonist being temporarily Director of the institute in the future for a bit (!!), there is YET ANOTHER giant huge
misunderstanding with her partner due to them not talking about things properly, going to absolutely ridiculous and
uncalled-for lengths, then a Dodo hunt, and a bunch more side plots in case you were not feeling sufficiently
entertained.

From looking at the summary of the next book, that's apparently just what the series is like, so I think this is my
exit.
