Time travel comfort food! This book starts out as adult time travel Hogwarts: masking as an institute, St Mary dabbles
in non-invasive time travel. Sorry, investigates major historical events in contemporary time. Our protagonist, a woman
of distinctly urban fantasy heroine characteristics, is a historian and has to go through some harsh training (yay for
training sequences) to join the small team retrieving information from the past.

The beginning is cute and popcorn-y: the protagonist's academia snark is funny and enjoyable, and the story moves down a
pretty regular path. When the time comes to escalate, though, it escalates rather dramatically and goes to a pretty dark
place. I'm not sure it does it very well, but I appreciated the effort.

I enjoyed a lot of minor stuff: the protagonist is oblivious in a way that the text only calls out indirectly. She is
also a historian with a focus on ancient history, and the intra-historian bickering was delightful. I think compared to
other Urban Fantasy, this series could have stood to introduce the series-wide conflict a bit later, but I appreciate
the book being upfront about where the series is going to go. While it's no great literature, it's generally a fun read,
with the exception of the two sex scenes, which try for the same levity as *The Calculating Stars* did, and it works
just as not. And, of course, don't look *too* closely at the logic and logistics. I'm looking forward to reading the
second part.
