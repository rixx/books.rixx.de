Ok, so Philip K Dick is just too esoteric for me. Every book I've read has about 40% that I really like, that are
clever, well-thought, and interesting. While the other parts are weird, sometimes they feel kafkaesque, or trippy, and I
don't get them (or at least, their relevance and what they do in the book). As always I liked the premise (also, I'm a
sucker for Nazis-have-won books), but the more it progressed the more I felt like I should take some drugs to properly
understand the book. Not to say that it's a bad book, but it's just not for me.
