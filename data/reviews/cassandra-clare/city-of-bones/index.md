YA fantasy. Clary loses her mother, finds her father Valentine and meets her brother Jace. Vampires, werewolves, fay,
the works. Short, and enjoyable just like fast food is occasionally enjoyable. Twilight level with less thought and more
action.

Not surprised though that the author used to be a bullying profiteer in the early Harry Potter fanfiction days. And
would you believe it, she had a fanfic back then called *Mortal Instruments* about an incestous relationship between Ron
and Ginny. Well, here's to hoping that this series won't contain sibling relationship dramâ€“ oh wait.
