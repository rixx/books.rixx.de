Ellison condemned a bunch of stories to a slow, sad death by never releasing *The Last Dangerous Visions*. The book was
originally announced for publication in 1973, and many stories were frozen/locked in awaiting first publication there.
Ellison continued to promise publication until his death in 2018. Authors quite literally died in these 45 years (and of
course, stories often don't age particularly well, so even the authors still alive might not want to publish them).
The book is, btw, again set to release, this time in 2023 (writing in 2022), by J Michael Straczynski.

Another story: apparently, at conventions, he'd walk in front of [Asimov](/isaac-asimov/) to prevent him from groping
women, which he was known to do. Jesus fuck.
