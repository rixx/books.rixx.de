I liked the premise of one person (well. -ish) changing the world via dreams, inclusing heavy retroactive changes. I
liked the characterisations, and the overall themes, even if the pacing was a bit off. I even agree with the (Taoist)
philosophy shown behind it, but I don't like being shown philosophies forcefully in books, and this felt like it. Not
even close to horrible Narnia levels, but … tending to a bit Philip-K-Dick style storytelling. Didn't enjoy the last
third for that reason. A good book, for sure – but not close to my favourite Le Guin books.
