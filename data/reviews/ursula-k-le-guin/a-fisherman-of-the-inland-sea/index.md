I'm not a huge fan of short story collections – they're hard to rate, I don't like reading stories bunched together all
that much, it's just not for me. So giving **A Fisherman of the Inland Sea** 4/5 stars means a lot – Ursula Le Guin
always manages to show deeply familiar human sides to technological developments. Here I was impressed with her ability
to show groups (families and other groups) interact and evolve. The deep understanding of individuals growing older,
away from home or at home, was touching too, and terribly well executed. Oh, the humanity, you know?
