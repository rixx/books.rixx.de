City of Illusions is part of the **Heinish Cycle**, and a good one at that! This book starts out slow, and then
meanders, and then reaches a pretty good ending â€“ that is cut way too short, in my opinion. As is common with Ursula K.
le Guin, we see the protagonist on a not-quite-intentional journey. The large time gaps in the beginning helped to keep
the story moving, and made me feel invested in the protagonist's search for his past, without feeling that I was just
seeing a common trope. The resolution was typical of le Guin, who rarely shies away from difficult discussions and
decisions.  If only the ending hadn't been so short! I'd love to read a book on the last 20% of the story plus what came
after.
