  tldr: As good as the first part, in different ways. Still sci-fi focused on culture
    and language, and I want more.

Generally, *A Desolation Called Peace* is nearly as good as [A Memory Called
Empire](/arkady-martine/a-memory-called-empire). It replaces parts of the intrical cultural commentary with very alien
aliens who need to be communicated with, but surprisingly, the aliens are one of the weakest parts of the book. This is
basially the anti-Tchaikovsky, where humans are inevitably more interesting than even hive mind aliens.

The weak parts of the book echo the first book, really: The story wraps up too neatly, the character development
is put off too much where inconvenient, and the book would like to spend more time on exploring the culture than on the
plot. Which works for me, so no complaints there.

I wish the aliens had been more intriguing, but I minded less than I expected. The aliens make a distinction
between being a real person (aka undying hive mind) and the others, who they characterise as "thinking language". As
somebody with a primarily nonverbal mode of thinking, that was exciting at first with … zero payoff, which is
a wasted opportunity. In exchange, Martine does an *occasionally* very good job of portraying the trouble of
learning an alien language during first contact – but then goes back to being really more into the culture and politics
of the empire.

What really got me is how Martine continues the commentary on cultural primacy and the feeling of being just outside a
culture and language that you really love. The protagonist's position and feelings echo my experiences with
English-speaking people and countries to a degree that is uncanny, particularly as written by an American. Being always
not exactly included, never quite on solid ground, even while you feel yourself losing fluency and comfort in your
native language hits hard, and made me reconsider some priorities. You may have noticed that in a 3-month, 18 book gap
in reviews on here. I'll find words for it eventually, please hold the line.
