Confession: this is my first time reading Beowulf, in any translation. So of course I picked a new, modern,
controversial one: what else? Maria Dahvana Headley had previously written *The Mere Wife*, Beowulf with Grendel's
mother as protagonist, and she has some very intriguing criticism of longstanding translation traditions.

Writing this, it occurs to me that I found her foreword and commentary more interesting than the actual translation,
which … is true? She discusses her interpretation of Beowulf, as less of a hero story, and more of a manual for how to
live as a man, if you are more like the monsters, having to tame your wildness and find your place in society. Not
always successfully, either: Beowulf's last stand is not exactly wise, and is called out as having disastrous
consequences for the survivors in-text.

Most interesting are her comments on Grendel's mother, of course. The traditional translations give her claws (despite
the word "fingrum" also meaning "fingers"), and calls her a monster as translation of "aglæc-wif" – but that's the
feminine form of "aglæca", which is commonly translated as "hero" when applied to Beowulf, and "monster/fiend" when
referencing Grendel/his mother/the dragon. Comparing to other early English sources, the best translation would be
"formidable fighter" without moral judgement.

In terms of form, she chose to go with a modern poem instead of retaining the early meter. I'm usually all for meter
(hideously underutilised in a lot of modern poetry!), but I'm also into modern reinterpretations of ancient poetry
(looking at Christopher Logue here), so no protest from me. She decided to try for the then-popular alliterations, and
… well, I don't know. Sometimes they were good, but often they felt just as forced as bad meter and bad rhymes would
have been.

Her language is explicitly modern, and the much-quoted *Hwæt!* as *Bro!* is something I can absolutely get behind, but
it also foreshadows the weaknesses of her translations. Which I liked, in general, but unfortunately, I had read
Christopher Logue's Iliad beforehand, and the contrast in quality doesn't do Beowulf any favours. The biggest issue was
the lack of authenticity: The translation uses slang just to be modern, but it's clearly not the author's slang – usage
is often slightly off, or has a "how do you do, fellow kids" vibe. Which is too bad, because the visceral authenticity
(with modernity as a medium, not the goal) was what I liked most about Logue's Iliad.

I'll give you some quotes of both good and bad passages, so you can judge yourself:

- Grendel was the name of this woe-walker, / Unlucky, fucked by Fate
- You know how it is: every castle wants invading, and every family / has enemies born within
- Horrors happen, I’m grown, I know it. / Bro, Fate can fuck you up.”
- I’ve racked my brain, bro, but, Unferth, / I can’t unpack any similar stories of / heroics from you.
- Any season / is a season for blood, if you look at it in the right light.
- Meanwhile, Beowulf gave zero shits. […] / He’d meet this murdering mother /   under mere, and amend her existence.
- Listen to me, boy. Keep your shit straight. /   I’ve been fostered by frost-seasons, fathered by time, /   and I’m dropping knowledge now.
- Beowulf blasted his last boast: /   “I laid my life down on the daily when I was your age. /   Now, gray guardian though I am, I’ll show you /   how it’s done. I’ll kill this creature if it’s the last thing / I do.”

On a completely unrelated note, shout-outs to the part of Beowulf that is about the buglar who "became the thirteenth
man" to steal a golden cup, from a dragon, who retaliates … Hmmmmmmmm!
