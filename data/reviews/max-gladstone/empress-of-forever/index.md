Max Gladstone is an author I like a *lot*. He's half of the brilliance of *Time War*, and his Craft Sequence is amazing
second-world urban fantasy. I went into this book curious how Gladstone would approach Space Opera, but confident I
would like it – boy, was I disappointed. It took me the better part of a month to dig through this book, and it ust
dragged on.

Our protagonist is a ruthless super-rich tech genius dick who sacrificed pretty much everything for her success (owning
a super-Bezos like empire). She gets transported into a different world/universe/whatever, and is probably meant to take
us on what cover texts tend to call a tour de force of that world. If that doesn't sound very relatable or compelling:
damn straight. Her main motivation is supposed to be getting back to Earth, because a) she has plans and b) she maybe
discovered her humanity idk man. In an effort to make up for her inherent dickishness, her intelligence and skill at
thinking her way out of a problem is highlighted, sometimes, when the plot feels like it. I didn't care about her, but
that's not to say that the story would have been better without her. I'm not even sure how this was supposed to work, as
it's clear she's intended to be an arrogant bastard.

Anyhow, she gets transported to the wider universe and has, again for reasons, to battle the Empress of Forever, who is
Evil because she destroys civilisations when they reach a too high level of tech advancement, because that kind of thing
attracts the Blight (or whatever it's called). The mid-crisis reveal <span class="spoilers">that the two sociopathic
megalomanic women are the same person</span> didn't feel very surprising at that point.

I'd normally like the way technology raises some people to near-godhood with powers to go with it, and the space monks
looking for meaning in the Empress and her leftovers, and beings eating matter on the scale of plantes, and the revenge
arc of the actually pretty cool imprisoned vengeful goddess Zanj, and the people who live with a mix of iron age and
future tech remains in their shattered world, the humans who can think their way into spaceships and become them rather
than pilot them – but all of it is just thrown together, a big heap of uncoordinated worldbuilding that occasionally
remembers to advance the story. Don't get me started on the romance that would have been much better off as a
friendship, or a swift kick to the protagonist's head. The romantic interest at some point tells the protagonist
honestly everything that's wrong with her in a giant, well-justified rant, and then … nothing happens.

There are glimpses in the worldbuilding of what I usually love about Gladstone, but not enough. Or rather: too much, too
uncoordinated, without rhyme or reason. And the paragraph-level writing is as amazing as always, and possibly the only
reason that this isn't a one-star review. I'm not sure what happened with this book, and I'll definitely read
Gladstone's upcoming urban fantasy release, but I sure hope that the Craft Series wasn't a one time wonder.
