  tldr: Weaker than the other Craft books, despite having characters who are more
    fun. Fantasy-econ take on gentrification, huh?

I keep enjoying the Craft Sequence stuff, even when the lessons are so on the nose it's kinda meh. This is the
gentrification one, which is good because we get backstory for Temoc, the priest, and a bit more insight into the King
in Red. It's not as strong as the other books, even though I enjoyed the characters more, but hey, what can you do.
