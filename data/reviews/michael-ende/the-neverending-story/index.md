Neverending – oh, if only! I loved this book as a kid, and there are infinite possibilities for tie-ins (though arguably
the book is better off without them).

The Neverending Story is special to me. It has some serious messages, and I read it early enough to have them buried
deep in my brain, emerging slowly as I age. The first one was about being the loner kid who loves books, and how that
doesn't have to be a bad thing. The next one was about not forgetting your friends, and being there for them. Then we
have a sharp reminder that when you do new things, you become a different person, which is both an opportunity for
change and a danger if you're not careful. An understanding that wishes emerge naturally from within, and that when you
get your wish, a new one will soon arise. And finally, a belief that you can, in fact, get what you wish for, often just
by focusing on the wish.

If you know only the movie, give the book a chance – the movie is very different, and covers only roughly the first half
of the book.
