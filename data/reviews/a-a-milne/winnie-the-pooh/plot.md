Pooh, after getting manhandled down the stairs in a slightly disturbing manner, he's named protagonist by Christopher
(who is *not* the villain of the story).

Pooh immediately proves himself to be a practical philosopher: he considers the Nature of the Bear, and also goes ahead
trying to solve it (first by climbing a tree, then, ambitiously, by flying). Next, he shows off how asking for help
really brings a community together, after showing how overstaying your welcome is the real proof you're living in a
civilisation. He also considers the nature of Plato's Cave, and what we can really learn from tracks in the sand:
surprising results ensue. Truly, “Optimus ursus mundi es”.

However, Pooh is not the only philosopher around – Eeyore teaches us to not stop with questions like “Cur?”, and instead
expand to “quemadmodum?”, or even “haudquaquam huiusmodo?”, if you're brave. Together, Pooh and Eeyore discover that
philosophy is not sufficient if you're not able to embody your philosophy, and explore practical philosophy and
community management to allow Eeyore to heal. And, while he's busy healing his friends, Pooh also helps Piglet with some
exposure therapy when Piglet loses touch with reality and is trapped in dreams of large, aggressive fauna.

In the old discussion of effort vs results, Pooh comes down heavily on the side of effort, or rather, accepting any
results produced by effort as lucky and productive – an outlook many managers could stand to learn from. Just look how
unhappy Eeyore would be without it. Kanga, for example, has to be taught to let go and accept a certain measure of
fortunate uncertainty when dealing with a growing child – and this time it is Piglet who is doing the teaching.
Shout-outs to Pooh coming up with a new Dies Irae, just to assist in this lesson (see quotes). And, while he's at it
with the poetry, he also shows how a bit of beauty can support plenty of community interaction, if handled right (see
also quotes).

In the final chapters, the story turns to darker issues: How to survive catastrophes of various kinds as a community.
Starting with a horrible flood, they graduate to true horror: Saying goodbye to friends.
