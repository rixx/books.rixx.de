Dürrenmatt will always punch you in the face. This time he's talking about corruptability and the corruption brought
about by wealth. It's the terrifying story of a man sold out by his entire community for the promise of wealth. It's
about ethics and justice and avarice. I loved it. Seeing it on stage when I was 17 was transformative.
