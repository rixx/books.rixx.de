Our protagonist has a breakdown and, because the village inn is full, is invited to stay in a local mansion. It turns
out that his host is a retired judge, and together with his friends, a retired prosecutor and a retired attorney, they
stage a mock-trial of their guest – all in good fun – of crimes yet to be named. The rest is very Dürrenmatt. Short and
enjoyable, but always with an edge of unease.
