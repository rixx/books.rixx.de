Satirical stage play, in a Swiss asylum for the insane. The three inmates think they are Newton, Einstein and Moebius.
Or so the initial story goes – there's much more to it than that.  The murder mystery is just window dressing – the real
questions are about ethics in science and the self-destructive tendencies of humanity, and are mostly informed by atom
bombs and the cold war. It's dusty, dated – but still packs a punch though – never underestimate
Dürrenmatt. He plays dirty and does it well.
