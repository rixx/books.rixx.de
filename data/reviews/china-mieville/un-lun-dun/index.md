Exactly how you'd imagine a magical London YA novel by China Mieville to turn out: appropriately wonderful weird
worldbuilding, good enough story arc. Above average amount of painful puns. Plus, and this is something you might not
think, actually suited for kids. I wasn't sure Mieville would reign in his weirder tendencies.
