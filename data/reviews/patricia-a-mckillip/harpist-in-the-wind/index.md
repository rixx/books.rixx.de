  tldr: Interesting conclusion to the trilogy. Not what I expected. Good stuff, and
    rewards attention to detail.

Concluding this series, the established power couple tackles the remaining big riddles in the world, and finally figure
out what's going on. Some parts of it were obvious, at least the direction â€“ but the conclusion surprised me and was
pretty impressive. I can't say more because it'd be impossible to do without heavy spoilers.

What I will say is that this book, much more so than the two previous ones, rewards careful reading. So much takes place
in an aside or as a hint that is resolved in an allusion later on, and it's a great experience when you figure things
out just as the protagonist does.
