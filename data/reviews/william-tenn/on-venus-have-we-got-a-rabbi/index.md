  tldr: Extremely tongue-in-cheek short story, published in 1974. Available online,
    including a reading by the author. Hilarious.

You know how I'm into space monks, aka scifi that has serious thoughts about religion? Yes, this is it. Hilariously
tongue-in-cheek, there's nothing I did not like about this short story. It's written in 1974, and thankfully available
online, both in text and as an even more hilarious reading by the author. The tone is *everything*. Space jews arguing
about the inclusion of alien species. Let me just say “Papa, you’re so old-fashioned! You yourself told me that the blue
Jews from Aldebaran show how adaptable our people are.” – if this doesn't sell you on the story, pass it by.
