Feynman's autobiography was too far on the stream-of-consciousness side for my tastes, but at least this way the
reader gets a very direct feeling for what Feynman was like. Not always the best person, and with his share of faults
and stupid/bad behaviour, but at the same time very engaging and open. Some parts dragged on, but most were interesting
in at least some respect. An enjoyable read in the end.
