Sometimes it's just down to the order or operations. I read Eragon after the Lord of the Rings, and so I disliked it and
thought much of its plot was a cheap knock-off version with more wish fulfillment. That was not entirely fair, but I was
ten at the time and being angry about bad books was my thing. It's certainly an impressive book considering the age of
the author at the time.
