Igraine is a very sweet book for kids. Igraine wants to be a knight, not a boring wizard like everybody else in her
family, and she gets her wish â€“ and has to save her family in the process. A bit saccharine in the general tone,
possibly, but the execution borders on dry and is just generally sparking joy.
