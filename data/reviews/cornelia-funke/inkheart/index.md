Inkheart *understood* me. It understood my dorky love for books, and how I wanted to jump into a story. It got feeling
alone, and it got nerding out with others. And it made other books come to life â€“ and I loved it for it. Some of it
follows YA rules and annoyances: it's slow to develop and the protagonist is sometimes grating. But that's perfectly
fine when balancing it against the imaginative story.
