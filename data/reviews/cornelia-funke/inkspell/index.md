More Inkworld shenanigans: Meggie now reads herself and others into the story, and also has to deal with the original
author, who turns out to be very annoying. The story builds extremely slowly and I enjoyed it mostly for the
worldbuilding. The characters are – with one exception – unimpressive and not exactly enjoyable.
