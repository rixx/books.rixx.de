Interesting, but ultimately not satisfying. Imagine a Handmaid's Tale style dystopian future but with xenolinguistics.
There's a subtle female language-based resistance, and the whole setup is neat, but it doesn't really go anywhere. Life
goes on, women are mistreated, leadership remains the samel

There is an ending, but it's not satisfying, though the rest of the trilogy might resolve it. Predictably, all male
characters assume women are completely inferior, and are just various shades of bad. All women are subtly and cleverly
resisting. All in all a good idea with flat execution â€“ though I can't say which part of it was good-at-the-time.
