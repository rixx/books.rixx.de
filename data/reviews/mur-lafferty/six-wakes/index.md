Six Wakes is a scifi murder mystery in space: Cloning is real, but may only be used to prolong one's own life. A
generation starship is staffed with six clones who will re-clone until the ship reaches its destiantion. But suddenly
all six find themselves murdered and re-awaken without any memory of the last 25 years of the journey. As plots go, this
one is good â€“ sadly the writing was uneven and I'm not a mystery person, so despite the coherent worldbuilding
and the simple-but-plausible characters, I wasn't drawn in too much. If you like space and mysteries though, I can
definitely recommend it.
