Not my thing. Good solid characters, and the whole "living on the ground of the ocean evolving into something else was
alright". The only part I really liked were the headcheese (erm, neural nets), and the fact somebody figured out which
genetic side they'd take by asking one if it preferred Chess or Checkers. That was neat.
