  tldr: A Lord of the Rings fanfic with such a quality of writing and depth of research
    that I have to revisit it occasionally. Plus, it has art. And a soundtrack.

Sansûkh is an incredibly well-researched, detailed, well-written Lord of the Rings fanfiction, telling the whole story
from the perspective of the dead dwarves keeping watch over their relatives. Its protagonist is Thorin Oakenshield, and
in addition to all the plots told by the primary books, it also features Erebor and Mirkwood. The writing is very
appropriate and well-done, and I enjoyed every part of it tremendously. It's funny, and it's epic, and it's very much as
it should be.

Additionally, there are a ton (>300) of adorable artworks, an [audiobook](https://sansukhpodfic.tumblr.com/) of good
production quality, the beginnings of a graphical novel, and a
[SOUNDTRACK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1un_F2y82wiA12RWRI25XgUKKS60a8N2IfHcNnT6liPs/edit), including sheet
music.  The soundtrack is linked in the appropriate sections of the story, and it's amazing.
[This](https://determamfidd.tumblr.com/post/66451748399/sansukh-the-masterpost) page lists sub-pages which link to all
the additional content.

If you want more fanfics in this general direction (though none as good), look at [determamfidd's recommendation
