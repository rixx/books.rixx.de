A sweet, sweet book: Princess Cimorene can't be bothered with pesky princess stuff, because she'd much rather learn
Latin, or fencing, or cooking, or bookkeeping, or juggling, or literally anything any profession at court could teach
her. Frustrated and running from a terrifyingly boring engagement,  she runs away and goes to live with a dragon. She's
the first princess to do so without being kidnapped first, but things work out pretty well – her practicality sees her
ready to deal with magic and sorting the library (plus, extremely sensibly fireproofing herself), but also with annoying
knights with a saviour complex, evil wizards and dragon politics.

The story is sweet, the writing adorable, and it never once goes too far into “not like the other girls”. Yes, there are
annoying superficial princesses, just as there are annoying superficial princes. But there is also an extremely cool
witch, plus the princess and the dragon, and everything works out really well. Cimorene and Tiffany would like each
other.
