  tldr: Peter Pan, a trans boy, returns to Neverland to figure things out and finally
    grow up, by the power of Hook's pretty eyes or something.
---

Peter Pan returns to Neverland, coming to terms with being a trans boy in bad old England. He starts out as a cruel boy
and experiences some character growth … through the magic of Hook's pretty eyes? I don't know, y'all.

If you're charitable, this is an interesting take on toxic masculinity among transmasculine people, and then it is
interesting as a concept – but doesn't do all that much with it. The character growth is by virtue of the plot demanding
it and wishful thinking, and the previously mentioned pretty eyes. Could've been much better.
