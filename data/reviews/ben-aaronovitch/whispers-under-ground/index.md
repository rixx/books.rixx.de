Magic develops further, and we get an entire new race below London. Still very witty, and I just cannot resist a "magic
underground in London" story. At the same time, it's a whodunnit, and the banter continues the strong suit of the
series, while the plot (especially the overarching series plot) does well to stay in the background.
