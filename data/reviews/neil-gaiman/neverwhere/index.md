Neverwhere must have been my first adult Urban Fantasy, and I was head over heels for it. Gaiman is elegant to the point
of being flowery as always, but not as over-the-top as he sometimes gets. Nice balance in all things. If you have the
chance, listen to the full cast audiobook! Originally intended format, and excellent.
