Again - Neil Gaiman can write short stories like the best of them.

 - The Case of Four and Twenty Blackbirds: Neil wrote an entire (glorious) story based in nursery rhymes. Challenging for a non-native reader, but not impossible - I think I found most of the references and learned a lot.
 - Troll Bridge: The closest Neil Gaiman comes to Stephen King, I think. Very touching, very sweet, if you're into, y'know, people's lives being eaten.
 - Don't ask Jack: Short horror story - I think if it grips you, it's hard to get over it, but it didn't quite work on me.
 - How to Sell the Ponti Bridge: I kinda wanted to like that one more than I actually liked it, the trickster seemed not quite fleshed out as much as I'd have liked, but the storytelling was marvellous nonetheless.
 - October in the Chair: I knew that one already and loved to re-read Runt's story.
 - Chivalry: *So* lovely, *so* English, and not about the Holy Grail at all.
 - The Price: Wonderful dark story - who doesn't want to believe that a certain black cat can save us from the devil?
 - How to Talk to Girls at Parties: Knew that one already, was as lyrical as I remembered it to be.
 - Sunbird: I really love this story, and that's why the Ponti Bridge didn't work for me - it was similar, but not quite the same.
 - The Witch's Headstone: Well, it's the Graveyard Book short story and I adore that book.
