The story starts with the dog being put down – “You shouldn’t feel sorry for her. She lived forever. ”. Then the
protagonist, mentally, travels back in time to discover if he could save the dog – or just live with her again. Every
time is the first time. But upon returning … think, has it always happened the way it happened this time? Surely.

But can the protagonist be sure? Can he send information in a deja vu?

Possibly leading to never hitting her with his car (dun dun duuun reveal after most of the story is over), thus giving
her a life – but without him. Or … not. (Not, definitely).
