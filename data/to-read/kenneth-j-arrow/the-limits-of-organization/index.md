you want to express your intrinsic values, but have to live with and for others.
"How can I behave with urgency and conviction when so much is vague or in doubt"
anarcho-syndicalism wants unity between self and society
libertarians want to deny the role of collective action as much as possible
book seeks to resolve this as an economist. lol rationality
ofc rationality is only as good as your unexamined premises
TENSION between: values and opportunities (scarce)
we need groups to distribute/mediate conflict for opportunities, and to profit from cooperation
attaching a price to goods and services is efficient (for a very economic meaning of efficient)
advantages: can theoretically balance itself, and the participants only really need to know their own needs, plus they
get to feel free
disadvantages: the degree of freedom is often very small, propagates selfishness, and therefore should not be the sole system
price system does not care for *justice* of income/distribution – it doesn't produce anything defensible
you cannot price some things – pollution of common goods like air/water
you cannot price some things without making them impossible: public roads, particularly in cities
some things can be priced, but not bought: trust, loyalty, truth
so both for more efficiency and for more justice, we need something more (nb: or other) than a price-based market
enter stage left: government. better at realizing trust/empathy/externalities, but very limited by corruption (through power and money both)
but lol, nobody has good suggestions for distributive justice, except "not like that!!!"
humans want different things. providing them all with the same things is not justice
and NO DEAR AI PEOPLE, you cannot from the outside predict what somebody wants
ethics/morality are another ~institution that is necessary. (aka: conscience) leads to some communal responsibility
communal responsibility and individual needs are in conflict
communal responsibility is even more complex than you think – maybe completing a nonsensical action is important because
it strengthens community? what about an actually harmful one? go back on a promise if premises change??




Rabbi Hillel: “If I am not for myself, then who is for me? And if I am not for others, then who am I? And if not now,
when?"
"an employee is selling willingness to obey authority"
