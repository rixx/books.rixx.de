popular history, people history. make people understand where we come from
others did it badly, then so can i!
not a good history of england, but an okay rant by a good writer, or a good rant by an okay writer.

very romantic, but always with a goal. eg starts out explaining how christianity contradicted slavery, and how that went
for rome and the **province of britain**
highlights the transition from nearly-modern accounting and rationality during rome and late rome, and the suddenly
sprouting **age of legends**. interesting thoughts on decline, and how conservative and progressive mindsets are
somewhat reversed when you live in a declining age instead of a rising/progressing one. barbaric times as the times of
heroes. he emphasises trusting legends more than fact, because the legendary vibe has more impact on us today than any
fact out there
**the defeat of the barbarians** is possibly the best chapter, and spends a bit of time arguing against race theories
and race-based history. also finally gets a bit of object-level action.

interesting to see what he considered common knowledge, wonder how that stands up
