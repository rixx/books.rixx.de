bibliography of The Light Ages: 
Owen Gingerich, The Book Nobody Read (New York, 2004), recounts the author’s exciting worldwide quest to see every surviving copy of the first two editions of Copernicus’ On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres ; along the way we learn a great deal about that 1543 masterwork and the charged atmosphere of sixteenth-century astronomy.
