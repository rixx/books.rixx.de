Weaving Fate is, as the title indicates, a woo book. The author believes in magic and assumes you do, too. I found this
strangely refreshing, to be honest, and it made it easy to separate out the useful stuff, for my intents and purposes.

What I took from it, when you remove the fluff, were two meditation exercises (one of which won't work for me) and a
journaling practice.

## Quotes

- Style matters, even if we only notice this when confronted by itsabsence.
- Serious play is where we are playing, exploring, and having fun but with a lot of intentionality behind it.
- we can define ‘realism’ as the belief that reality needs defending.
- We will have fun while doing this, simply because it’s an option, and it seems like a better one that just suffering through!

## Methodology

Start with the recommended process, but modify to suit personal style. Then pay close attention to felt sense /
feelings, and modify further. Written instructions can help avoid common failure modes, no more than that. This part,
particularly being clear about motivations and needs, does not bear half-assing well. Because all of this is part of a
complex interconnected system (our psyche, and every other psyche around us), this is fairly unpredictable and much
harder than eg writing or following a program.

As all work, the starting effort is uncomfortable and can be destabilising. To effect change, this book proposes to
alter (re-interpret) the past and envision the future. The closer to the roots you start to change things, the faster
and more impressive the change. Trying to change just the most surface-level outcomes, in comparison, is hard and slow.
Much of it is general introspection work: Figure out who you are / which facets are part of you, and which are outside
influences overriding your preferences.

Side note: Move more. Walk. Carry things. Squat and lift things. Rest in quiet. Your body and brain will lead you to a
better life if you allow them less sedentism and less stimulation overload. "Find a way, if you are able, to both move
the body and to allow it real quiet, real stillness. Walking outside, yoga, weight training, running, cycling, paddling,
swimming, calisthenics, martial arts, dance, and hiking are all possible pathways of movement to explore. […] Find a way
that suits you to be truly quiet. Meditation, walking, being in nature, and just generally witnessing both mind and
environment are the goals here. Sitting on a park bench, on the beach, or your balcony, and just watching the formations
of both thought and external phenomena are beautiful expressions of this."

## Liminal spaces

Don't just focus harder on the things you want. Focus more softly, look at things from your peripheral vision, vibe with
them instead of applying moar pressure. One way to do this is to occupy the headspace here named "liminal gnosis". You
can enter this space in a few ways, and he recommends progressive relaxation.  He gives a meditative text, to either
learn and use, or to record and listen to, titled Bone Induction. Copied below¹ for my own use.

A harmful concept to liminality are big obstructive ideas ("monoliths") like desire, wealth, anger, change, stability,
and so on. Approaching them by following the general script provided by society usually doesn't end well, and you want
to approach them laterally, instead of following the heads-on way and accepting them as either must-have or must-avoid
or must-destroy.

## Black Book

Journaling exercise to support change. Sub-parts: The journal, the writing, 

### The preparation

The black book is a physical journal (any journal, of any colour, no Henry Ford intended). The pen can be any pen,
though of course one that can be re-filled is preferable. It's important that both items could plausibly be a real
journal for you.

Then comes the woo. Aidan wants it (and all items in use, for example pens) to be consecrated: dedicated to the purpose
and used for nothing else. As I'm an old Catholic, I'm comfortable with this concept and a bit surprised to see it here.
You'll need annointing oil (any kind of oil in a small bottle, optionally mixed up with smells) and candles. Other
possible implements include incense (really?), cards to help pick out topics. A piece of cloth 15-20cm across, and some
dirt. Yes, from a crossroads. And while you gather these things, be intentional and maybe talk to them about what you
intend to do.

Consecrate these things a day or two before the full moon, he says. (What? Yes, I know.) Consecration takes at least an
hour, up to four. Take the stuff mentioned above plus water, sea salt, vinegar, string, three silver-coloured coins, and
a lancet (*sigh*).

Create a charm bag plus talisman – basically something you invest a lot of life-like energy and symbolism in. Collect
the dirt from a crossroads, ask for permission first, then bury three silver-ish coins for the three fates. The cloth
can be anything, but from living things is better (not synthetic that is. Cut up an old pair of jeans or something).
Herbs you like from the supermarket.

The consecration ceremony: Cleanse the cloth with salt and water, breath into it (think: animating), speak something out
loud. Place soil inside it, talk to it too. Same for all other things you want in there, like herbs. Add some bodily
fluid, spit works. Say final words to the open thing, tie it up, speak some more things, seal with oil. Wash the pen
with salt water with a few drops of vinegar, dry, annoint, say some things, place with the bag. Purify the book with
salt, water, vinegar. Consecrate a page with bodily fluids. Sit with your tools. Possibly make your first entry. Put out
candles, sit with hands on ground to take off excess power. Drink a bit of water, eat a bit. Sign with your name (or a
name that reflects who you aspire to be) or your sigil.

He suggests to take a cleansing bath with salted water and optionally some rosemary or basil once a week while working
on all of this.

### The journaling

Tone matters more than specifics. Internal consistency is not necessary at all. Less specific criteria yield faster
results (but think of the Genie). Focus on the for-you critical elements, no matter how overly specific or general. Feel
free to change directions.  Expect set-backs and corrections.

You write the journal as if the things you want have come to pass. Never express intent, alway express factual
experience. Don't date the pages unless that's important to you, because timelessness allows you fluidity, and not being
bound to a specific order of things. Eventings or mornings work best, to chronicle the past day as imagined.

Stay playful with your entries. Be specific. Write variations of the same entry. Emotions are strength, as are steamy
sex scenes. Putting in things you have only started as completed is also good: when you finish them, it strengthens the
whole complex. Describe sensory details! Dream big / follow small dreams to big conclusions. Be complex: not too focused
on any one thing. If something is really occupying your mind, try to mix/contextualise at least.

Focus on what outcomes look like and feel like. What are the fruits of your labour, what do they taste like?

Move the markers of what is possible for you. If you are working on hitting beginner level, talk about going
semi-professional.

If some entries are a mistake when looking back and do not reflect your goals after all, write CANCEL all over them,
tear them out and discard them. Additionally, maybe write more about the outcome that you have come to prefer, to
strengthen it.

Treat the book as a friend or ally. Feed it in ways that make sense to you (light a candle, cleanse with stuff, lick
your finger and press it to the page). Sign with your name or purpose-name. Feed the pen, too. Feeding can just be a
heart-felt thank you. At least once a week, make an offering to the group of charm+book+pen, and sit with them. You can
sing or talk or feed them energy eg from rubbing your hands.


## Corridor

Visualisation exercise to support change. You visualise some sort of corridor / some place with a lot of doors. See it
clearly, though it can be a different one every time – industrial, natural, a forest, a mansion, a castle, ...
Stepping through doors gives you access to a situation in your past, which you can then re-interpret or re-shape.
This will in turn change how you experience present and future events, since your perception is rooted in your past.

The corridor is best walked in liminal gnosis: meditation, half-dreaming, relaxed weaving. Use the bone induction or
other ways to get there.

Decide on a scene that you want to visit. Decide that your younger self will be receptive and open. You are in control.
The visit will be enjoyable and beneficial.  (Random access is better to be done with a ton of experience). Walk the
clearly felt corridor until a door feels right.  Turn, stop, open it, step through. Watch, listen, then interact with
your younger self. Talk.

Start with something that influenced you, but nothing traumatic. Get a sense of the whole process before reworking the
badlands. You can also "add" (invent, see) experiences that would have been useful at the time. You can invent (shift,
nudge) a reality where you have always exercised, etc.

You can combine this with the book, by writing journal entries about successful completed corridor experiences, to make
their effects stick.

All of this is not exactly used to create new memories – more to introduce a dissonance in a comfortable story we've
told ourselves, and that is keeping us back.

## Fever Stone

Imagine trauma as a wound that has healed in a bad way, and is festering. The root of the infection is the Fever Stone.
It is painful, but in itself neutral and bears no malice. It just is. It rests inside a person until it is dislodged or
until they die. Some stones are passed down through generations (and probably need to be healed first). The fever
stone's core is calcified power – power that fled from pain and then, as trauma responses do, never relaxed back into
normality. Our goal is to process/dissolve/transmute it back into raw power.

Go and find a nice small rounded rock. Needn't be perfect. It represents the collective trauma passed to you from your
lineage: parents and grandparents, culture in general, religion and history, the history of groups you belong to. Find a
bowl or jar or bottle, wash the stone in vinegar and leave it overnight in the bowl, covered in salt. In the morning,
take out the stone and place it in a calm outside location, where it can absorb the sun. Fill the bowl with water and a
teaspoon of salt and place it with the stone. Once a day, pour the salted water over the stone as if washing it and say

```
Fever Stone
Ailment of my ancestors
I wash you clean
That you afflict no more
Any of my line.
Your time is done
You no longer cause harm.
By water and sun I wash you clean.
May all my lines be blessed
Blood and Spirit
The wounds of the past
Washed clean by the Sea.
```

Refill the bottle, and put it back with the stone. If you feel you get too attached to the stone, throw it out and get a
new one. Do this daily until you are done.

For the inner work, create a mental space that's a temple where you aim to work on yourself, your mind, your strength,
where you refine and heal. Imagine it vividly. In time, it will be freely accessible to you. It's good to have some sort
of transition, like taking some steps, or walking a short path. You probably want some liminal gnosis, by whatever
method suits you best. If you can't see or feel anything, just talk yourself through it instead.

Practice entering the temple at will, several times per day. Once you can do that, enter the temple and see yourself
laid out there, alive and well. Ask yourself for permission to remove the stone. Take it out from under the navel, and
burn it. Thank yourself, and return. Practice all of this, and then do it some more. It's not the work itself yet, but
training.

Then practice a super weird, not-me daydream about a dragon: a relaxed small white dragon, with a golden egg in a pouch,
like a marsupial. The egg is basically a battery. Wake the dragon with gentle energy, then send it energy to store in
the egg. Once you are done, it stows the egg, falls asleep again and fades from your consciousness. Once this is
effortless and feels ready, proceed.

Walk the corridor, and find a younger self (like your self in the temple). Burn the stone, and give the released energy
to the dragon, to slowly redistribute to the body in a good/normal fashion. Choose moments that feel meaningful, like
trauma or like suppressing awful pain. Explain what you are doing and get consent (even just felt, from a sleeping
form). Do the thing. Write it into the diary for more effect. If you feel the need, repeat a specific situation or
choose new ones. Feel free to write about the general effect from the future view. Baby steps.

## Notes

He explains all the words and concepts, and that's rather neat. "Liminal means …", and so on. He also cites his sources,
and notes where he has a deep or shallow understanding of them, or where he changes his use of their terms.

## Questions

- how much do I have to have in mind when starting?
- how to deal with disappointment when putting my biggest dreams into words and see them NOT come true
- do I re-read old entries

¹ Bone Induction:

```

Sit or lie comfortably
now take a few moments
to attend to your body’s needs,
so that you can be
as comfortable as possible
for the duration of the session.

Find your breath
spend a few moments
feeling your breath
move in and out
of your body
waves of breathing.

Now breathe deeply
in a way that your belly
expands when you inhale
and contracts naturally
when you exhale
find a soft, comfortable rhythm
smooth belly breathing.

Good.

Begin to survey your body
let your attention visit the locations
and structures of the body
as I mention them.

Notice what I call the knots of your body
the joints where tension can often be held
become aware if you have tension in each knot
and allow it to release if you do.

Notice your jawyour shoulders
your elbows
your wrists
your hips
your knees
your ankles.

Now notice the bones
of your skull
spinal column
shoulder blades
arm bones
small bones of your hands
finger bones
rib bones
pelvis
leg bones
ankle bones
small bones of the feet
toe bones
let all of your bones
ride the soft waves
of your breath.

Now begin to notice
if your sense of self
your sense of consciousness
has shifted in any way.

Breathing in
breathing out
feel the waves of the breath
move through your body.

As you breathe
notice if your consciousness
moves beyond the confinesof your physical body
does it expand an inch beyond your skin?
maybe a few inches?
feel the waves of breath
expanding you
expanding your senses
like waves on the shore
coming and going
perfectly natural.

Spend as long as you like here,
and know that you can slip into sleep
or return to consciousness
```
