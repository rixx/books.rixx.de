  I couldn't resist the temptation to generate something like reading statistics from the data I use to build this site. These statistics are as inaccurate as they are fun, for a multitude of reasons.
</p>

<p>
For example, I didn't start tracking the books I read until I joined Goodreads in April 2015. I tried to reconstruct as much of my childhood reading as I could manage, but I failed miserably. Across long stretches in school I read more than a book per day – our school library only allowed us to check out six book at once, and it was only open three days per week, which did **not** work for me! Many of those books were re-reads, or me tearing through series after series of generic YA, so not much is to be mourned – but I may still add books retroactively, if and when they come up.

</p>

<p>
Or: of course there's no such thing as a book. To put it differently: what even is a book? These stats include everything from short stories to multi-thousand pages book collections – basically everything I wanted to log or note or have an opinion on.

</p>

<p>
But still, it's nice to look at, and I'm tempted to add more ridiculous charts, like mapping publication years against length, or temperature against ratings, or …

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Read books</th>
      <th>Reading pile</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  {% for heading, value1, value2 in stats.table %}
  <tr>
    <td>{{ heading }}</td>
    <th>{{ value1|default('-', true) }}</th>
    <th>{{ value2|default('-', true) }}</th>
  </tr>
  {% endfor %}
</table>
