Urban Fantasy is a genre I have very mixed feelings about. A lot of it is trashy, but some of it is outstanding. I tend
to read it in the place of comfort food, without any high expectations, which is probably the best way to approach the
genre as a whole. OSP have a good summary of what [constitutes Urban
Fantasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WYR6aRnfPo), if you're not sure what belongs in here.
