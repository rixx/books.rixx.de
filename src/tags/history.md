My reading list doesn't reflect this well, but I'm a bit of a history nerd. I hope to expand this list in the future â€“
and I'm always happy for recommendations!

There's a separate list for less serious [historical fiction](https://books.rixx.de/lists/historical-fiction/) that may
or may not have contributed significant parts of my history knowledge.
