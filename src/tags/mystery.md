I had a phase when I was 10 or 11 and read all mysteries I could get my hands on. This was good, broadly speaking,
because I learnt to recognise general patterns and kept it up until it got boring â€“ reading ten Agatha Christie books
per week will do that to you. I still go back to mysteries when I just want some comfort reads. It's not a genre that I
like particularly in general, with the exception of [Dorothy Sayers](/reviews/by-author/#Dorothy L. Sayers), who had her
Lord Peter [steal my heart](/reviews/2020/gaudy-night/) and refuses to give it back.
