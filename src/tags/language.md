I was a language nerd long before I knew what being a nerd meant. This list collects nonfiction and fiction where
language plays a loadbearing role. Books like [Because
Internet](/reviews/2020/because-internet-understanding-the-new-rules-of-language/) or [100 Ways to Improve Your
Writing](/reviews/2019/100-ways-to-improve-your-writing-proven-professional-techniques-for-writing-ith-style-and-power/)
qualify obviously, but so does [Babel 17](/reviews/2018/babel-17/), for entirely different reasons.

This list is short because I'm still working on tagging books I read in the past, but we're going to get there.
