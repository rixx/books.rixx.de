This book list is all about nerds learning things, figuring out systems, studying hard, going through [training
montages](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/trainingmontage) and the like. Education institutions (eg all
kinds of [Extranormal Institutes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtranormalInstitute)) are often part of
the deal, but don't guarantee that their story focuses on learning, as Hogwarts serves to prove.

It often comes with a side of [How Do I Shot Web](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb), if done
well.
