title: Myths and Legends
---

I grew up on fairytales and Greek mythology, so didn't consider them interesting or exciting. That was, until I
discovered authors who remixed mythological characters and creatures into their worlds, which is endlessly fascinating
to me, and a sure way to make me interested in any story. The first book that made me realise this was American Gods,
and I've been looking to get the same kick out of books ever since.
