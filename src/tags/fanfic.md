I used to be embarassed about the amount of fan fiction I've read – but honestly, there's no reason for that. Yes,
there's terrible fanfic out there, but there are gems, too. The unreadable stuff taught me to make fast judgements about
writing quality and drop the trash quickly, which is a skill that comes in handy with published books, too.

This list includes only the fan fiction that I could be bothered to include. Some of which is just comfort food, but
others, like [Sansûkh](/reviews/2019/sansukh/), are outstanding.
