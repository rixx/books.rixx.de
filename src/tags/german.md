In this list, I've tried to collect all the books that I've read in German. Some, like the books by [Walter
Moers](/walter-moers/) are so fundamentally and creatively German that I can't imagine how a
translation would work. Others are translations in the first place.

Nowadays, I read nearly exclusively in English, unless the original is not English to begin with. If I'm going to read
translated works, I usually go with the German translation: My German will always be better than my English, and I've
had better experiences with German literary translations in general.
