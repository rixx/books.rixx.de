Books for kids – or books that I read as a kid without *much* ill results. I'm gesturing at all of me.

Of these, I like the books by [Astrid Lindgren](/reviews/by-author/#Astrid%20Lindgren) best. Honourable mentions to the
[Thief Lord](/reviews/2001/herr-der-diebe/), some of [Erich](/reviews/2001/das-fliegende-klassenzimmer/)
[Kästner](/reviews/2004/emil-and-the-detectives/) and [the book that taught me to
read](/reviews/1998/alarm-im-kasperletheater/).
