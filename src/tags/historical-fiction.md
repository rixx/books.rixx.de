Books taking place in a historical setting, as long as the setting is loadbearing. The deciding criterion is "Is my
inner history nerd excited about this setting?". So, for example, The Count of Monte Cristo counts because the book
would fundamentally not work if it took place fifty years earlier or later, but generic Regency romances don't count,
because the historical parts are only window dressing.

There's a separate list for serious nonfiction [history books](/lists/history/).
