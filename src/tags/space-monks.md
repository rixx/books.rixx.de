title: Space Monks

Space Monks! If scifi describes religion in space in some way, it's usually very much my kind of thing. It's not really
about the religion itself, it's more that if a writer bothers to come up with a world that involves human or non-human
religion, they've put a significant amount of thought into it, and if people are motivated by that religion, the writing
usually isn't ignoring human emotions and interests entirely. These two characteristics make the books better than a lot
of average scifi books, and turned out to be a good way to group my interest.

But also, space monks are just cool.
