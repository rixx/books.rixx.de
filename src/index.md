# Welcome to log(book)!

This is where I valiantly try to keep track of

* the [books I’ve read](/reviews/), and my opinions on them
* which books [I want to read](/to-read/), and why
* useless but fun [statistics](/stats/)

The data gets synced to [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/rixx), but this site is the primary source. If you're
really interested in what I'm reading, you can [subscribe to the feed](/feed.atom) (feed with only reviews
[here](/reviews.atom)).

Thanks for the inspiration (and some of the code!) for this site go to [Lexie](https://books.alexwlchan.net). Thanks for
the content go to our civilisation and the preceding ones, to the people involved in the publishing industry – authors,
editors, layouters, translators, printers, illustrators, agents, publicists, marketers, book sellers, antiquarians –, to
my family for hooking me early and understanding that all a child needs to be happy are eighteen hours of uninterrupted
reading per day, and to my friends for their consistently good-or-interesting recommendations and their patience with
what they call my "reading habit".
