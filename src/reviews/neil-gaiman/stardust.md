Stardust is a joyful and lovely fantasy novel by Neil Gaiman, that has been turned into an equally joyful and loving
movie. I knew the movie first (though many of the details were way over my head back then), and it is superficially
similar and fundamentally different from the book â€“ both are good, though.

The best thing about Stardust is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's the model of the Hero's Journey, in the
model of a folkloric brutal fairytale world, with brilliant atmosphere. The young hero is terrible at first, though, but
in learning to navigate the magical world and the not-so-magical British village, he gets his bit of backstory, growing
up, redemption, love interest, blah blah. It's Neil Gaiman's talent as a storyteller that make this book stand out.

## Further Reading

For a similarly tongue-in-cheek meta-British hero's journey, read [The
Hobbit](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2000/the-hobbit-or-there-and-back-again). For more of the sensitive-yet-brutal
approach to Fantasy, [The Last Unicorn](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2017/the-last-unicorn) would work well. If you
just liked the village on the border of Faerie, give
[Lud-in-the-mist](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2019/lud-in-the-mist) a go.

If you want to read more of Neil Gaiman, I'd recommend [The Ocean at the End of the
Lane](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2015/the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane) for more atmospheric worldbuilding and
[American Gods](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2012/american-gods) for more epic bleak brutality.
