I liked Binti a lot more than Akata Witch, which I enjoyed very much. Binti was impressive and creative scifi, and the tha fast pace (du to the &lt;100 pages) was refreshing and very well executed. Binti is a wonderful protagonist, and the culture and belief system sketched out in the book made me hungry for more. (Also: living ships?! Living ships!)
At the same time, no matter how enjoyable this book was, I feel that it fails to address consequences to actions properly â€“ like the plot was laid out and will be followed regardless of second thoughts, or petty things like consequences for mass murder. This might have been alleviated by writing a bit more, so that more context is given, idk.
