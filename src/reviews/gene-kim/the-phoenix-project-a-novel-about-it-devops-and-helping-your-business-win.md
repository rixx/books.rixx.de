The Phoenix Project is a very nice management introduction for IT projects, talking about ITIL, about processes and about Agile Methods.

It's only very basically made up to seem like a novel instead of a textbook, but if you accept it as such (a very entertaining textbook instead of a novel), it works really well.

Also, the depiction of what can, must and will go wrong in IT Operations is just so spot on it might hurt.
