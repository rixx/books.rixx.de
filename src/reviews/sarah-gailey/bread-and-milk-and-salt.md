I like: [Bread and Milk and Salt](<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tor.com/2018/11/07/reprints-bread-and-milk-and-salt-sarah-gailey/" rel="nofollow">https://www.tor.com/2018/11/07/reprin...</a>) by *Sarah Gailey* is a delightfully creepy and scary fairytale short story. It's online, so there's no excuse for not reading it â€“ it's definitely worth it.
