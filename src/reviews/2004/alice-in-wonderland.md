The trippy book. I read Alice as a child, with a lot of confusion at first, and then with some resignation to the fact
that it would all make sense once I was older.

Well, about that.

But despite being confused about Alice, I also was fascinated and interested. I could tell that there was an internal
sense-making at work, a structure that I couldn't see or understand, but that I knew was there regardless. It made my
head hurt in good ways.

Also, the some figures in it are so vivid and weird that I never forgot them. Most of all the cat, whose grin is capable
of staying behind after the cat has vanished. Thinking about this also made my head hurt in a good way.

## Further Reading

Alice stands on her own in many ways. Of course there are many books that follow young girls into nonsensically
fantastic worlds, like [The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own
Making](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2016/the-girl-who-circumnavigated-fairyland-in-a-ship-of-her-own-making), or all
the [Wayward Children books](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2018/every-heart-a-doorway) running on portal fantasy. But
they do something different. They follow a pattern, and Alice does absolutely not even consider following a pattern.

I think the closest you'd come to the Alice books would be a New Weird book, except that even China Mi√©ville has way too
much consistency and coherence to come even close to Alice. If you don't mind losing the trippy part, and you just want
to see more dadaism, I'd probably recommend something like [Waiting for
Godot](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2008/waiting-for-godot).
