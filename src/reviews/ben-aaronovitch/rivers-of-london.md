I thought I was kind of done with Urban Fantasy after the slot of Jim Butcher's forced-funny, forced-dark supernatural
detective, but Ben Aaronovitch won me over. This series is more measured, more funny, and – admittedly – London feels
more like a city I want to read about compared with Chicago.

The protagonist/narrator is snarking nearly constantly, but he does so in a relatable way, not trying to be edgy, not
punching down. The whole book smacked of real life, and was a lot of fun. I appreciated supernatural Newton very much.
