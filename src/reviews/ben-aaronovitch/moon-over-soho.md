More of our favourite supernatural London policeman.

Jazz vampires. Would be five stars (for wit, and tugging at heart strings, and great descriptions) if I wasn't so irritated by the stereotyping. It's not bad, it might even be accurate and non-invasive, but I can't say, 'cause I'm not from London, so I'm mildly uncomfortable.
