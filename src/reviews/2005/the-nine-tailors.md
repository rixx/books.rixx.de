I stand by my previous 5 star rating even on the re-read. Of course, this is heavily influenced by the fact that I read this book several times as a kid, but still â€“ I think it is a good book. It's definitely by far my favourite book from Dorothy L. Sayers. Everything fits: characters, dialogue, extreme amounts of atmosphere, and even a plot worth the name. There are some side characters that I'd have loved to see more of, but that's the only criticism that comes to mind.
