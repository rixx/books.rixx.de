  text: Strangely enough, Stardust feels similar to Princess Bride. Though admittedly, the similarity is more prominent in the movie version of Stardust, which in turn cannot hope to compete with the Princess Bride movie.

Well, this was just plain funny. Great storytelling, great pacing, great everything. I caught myself looking up if William Goldman really had a son. He hasn't, thank god.

I probably should go and watch the movie now.
