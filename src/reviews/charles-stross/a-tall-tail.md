  tldr: Short story, showing off chemistry knowledge the way Umberto Eco shows off literature knowledge.

A nice Stross short story. Interesting how different cultures show off about different things, but in completely similar
ways. Umberto Eco will throw down with medieval/literature facts, and Charlie just needs you to know how much he knows
about chemistry off the top of his head.
