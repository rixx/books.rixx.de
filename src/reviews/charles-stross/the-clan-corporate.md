Miriam has to fight against everything: the family pressured by the secret services, her grief over Roland, the looming marriage â€¦ and nothing happens. Miriam spends most of the book locked in the second world, unable to do anything, and events unfold painfully slow (save for the last pages). Didn't really know what to do with this book.
