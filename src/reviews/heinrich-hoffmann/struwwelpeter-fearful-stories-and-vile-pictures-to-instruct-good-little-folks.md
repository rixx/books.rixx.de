An old book of German horror stories to frighten, erm, educate! kids. The rhymed stories are terrifying and illustrated,
and I can still recall lots of the rhymes now. They include

- The titular Struwwelpeter, a boy who refuses to cut or comb his hair or cut his nails, and is shunned.
- The wicked Friedrich, who hurts people and animals, until he is bitten by a dog and has to stay in bed while the dog
  eats his food.
- Pauline is left alone at home, and even though the cats warn her, she plays with matches, and she burns to death.
- Three boys taunt a dark-skinned boy, and in turn get dunked in ink so that they look even darker.
- Konrad is warned not to suck his thumbs. When he does it while his mother is away, a tailor appears and cuts off his
  thumbs with **giant scissors**. (These left an impression on me!)
- Kaspar refuses to eat his soup for several days, and continues losing weight until he dies.
- Philipp won't sit still, and in the end knocks over the entire dinner table. His name is still used for children who
  fidget a lot: Zappelphilipp.
- Hans has a habit of looking into the sky instead of where he's going, so he falls into a river. He's rescued, but his
  books float away, truly the worst fate.
- Robert goes outside during a storm, which catches his umbrella and he flies away.

Honestly, as a kid I didn't think anything about them â€“ they're not really more gruesome than a grandmother getting
eaten by a wolf, or a witch baked in her own oven. But then, they were only in use for entertainment, and never as
education, so I got off lightly.

## Further Reading

This book offers us a view into the attitude towards children 150 years ago, and shows that some patterns of behaviour,
like attention deficit with and without hyperactivity, were well-known in certain circles. I haven't read any more about
education in that time, but [Die roten Matrosen](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2004/die-roten-matrosen) features school
and educational attitudes in Germany between 1910 and 1920, which comes close and provides interesting historical
insights.
