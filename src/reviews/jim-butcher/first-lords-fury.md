First Lord's Fury is the last volume in the very very excellent **Codex Alera** series by *Jim Butcher*, and it leads the six-book story to a terrifying finale. I enjoyed it a lot - we get a lot of well-thought action, and character development that builds on the established development of the previous books and avoids common tropes. The plot and the ending were both very satisfying to me. I'd have enjoyed having somebody new, like Kitai, as a POV character, for example.
I think this is the first time among the six books that I thought the book was a bit weaker than its predecessor, which is a big compliment for the series. After finishing **First Lord's Fury** I immediately felt the need to re-read the entire series â€“ it's just that good.
