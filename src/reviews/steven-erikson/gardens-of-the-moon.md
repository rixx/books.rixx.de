I did not finish Gardens of the Moon – I gave up after a month, and that's saying something with 180+ read things in 2018. I just wasn't feeling it. It dragged on and on and on and – I'm sure this is a good book to many, and I have the feeling that the thing missing in Dune is also costing me Gardens of the Moon, but I won't even try this again.
