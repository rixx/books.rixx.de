A nice little book for children. Nothing special per se, but I think the way life under water is portrayed is very well
done. The smallest common issues are considered – where is the young waterman allowed to swim? Where's home? How does he
have to dress and what are his chores? This kind of attention to reality and detail is what I still love when reding
sci-fi.

## Further Reading

Another good children's book by [Otfried Preußler](https://books.rixx.de/otfried-preussler/) is
[The Little Ghost](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2001/the-little-ghost). If you're looking for more serious books by
him, [Krabat](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2005/krabat) is my favourite by far.
