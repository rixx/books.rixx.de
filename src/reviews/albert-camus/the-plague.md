The curious mood of The Plague is easy to recall even years after reading it. It's got a curious sense of detachment and
numbness that I enjoyed reading, as much as I hate symbolic storytelling normally. I'm still a bit annoyed by the plain
moralistic nonsense, though.

## Further Reading

Looking to get more depressed? [The Trial](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2008/the-trial) has you covered. Otherwise,
[Blindness](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2014/blindness) is often paired with this one, due to the similar theme and
philosophical approach.
