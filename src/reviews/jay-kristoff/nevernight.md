Nevernight is nice fantasy â€“ setting-wise, it's pretty similar to **Red Sister**, all about a young girl assassin going to a slightly religious assassin school, but it's pretty different in style. I think I liked Red Sister more (seeing as it has less Chosen One and more realism), and the witty banter-y narrator of Nevernight was a bit predictable sometimes. But the style was very Bartimaeus-esque, so this should be a book that fits many people's interests and likes.
