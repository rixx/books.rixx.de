Just a review to remind myself what happened here and why I liked the book.

We meet Mhari again! Bob is amazingly grown-up about it. Everybody realizes they get played early on â€¦ and still: people die. A lot of them. Including Angleton. Because their opponent is a century-old PHANG.

Written very smoothly, Stross is really in his element here. Feels effortless, and is easy to read.
