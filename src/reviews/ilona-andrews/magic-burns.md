Magic Burns continues where [Magic Bites](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2020/magic-bites) left off. It continues to be
pulpy urban fantasy, and if that's what you're looking for, this is a decent series to go for. This time we have
power-hungry Celtic gods and goddesses, plus more preparation for a reluctant snarky romance in following books â€“ at
least it's explicit, I'd be very annoyed otherwise. The worldbuilding holds up, but has slowed down a lot, which left me
a bit disappointed.
