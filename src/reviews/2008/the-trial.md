I don't do well with Kafka, and this one was no exception. I'm not debating the quality or skill of execution, it's just
that Kafka makes me feel truly terrible in a way that I don't care to introduce artificially if I can avoid it.

I remember sitting in school during breaks and reading this and suddenly feeling that my entire future could only be
like this, that this was all there ever could be. Shudders.

## Further Reading

For less depressing nihilism, [Waiting for Godot](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2018/waiting-for-godot) is absurdist in
a nice way. If you really need existentialist books, [The Plague](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2010/the-plague)
would work.
