  tldr: Excuse me, a ninja assassin and an anti-stereotype paladin? Light cost, but
    fun, with good dialogue and more than decent characters in a well-rounded world
    and an extremely over-the-top plot.

Excuse me, a ninja assassin and an anti-stereotype paladin? I'll have to read the second part right away. Both quippy
and touching, manages to strike a balance between excitement and character growth (while admittedly favouring excitement
a bit.)
