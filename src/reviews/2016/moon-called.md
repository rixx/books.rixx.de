Do you know those days (or weeks) when you just want some hot chocolate and reassuring books and a safe cuddly sofa? I enjoy trashy fantasy on those days, and Mercy Thompson definitely qualifies. It doesn't get one star because I really like reading trashy urban fantasy once in a while, and it is still better than Twilight or Shades of Grey, so what the hell. Two stars it is, but don't expect quality.
