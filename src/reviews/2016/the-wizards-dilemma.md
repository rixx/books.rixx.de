Nita faces temptation â€¦ a lot. Felt like a Hiob story in many ways. She has to deal with her mother dying and learns how to change whole universes to try and deal with it. Reminded me a lot of Buffy in the same situation, only a lot younger (but including the outcome and the younger sister, btw).

I didn't quite like how the criticizm of an overly-dependent Nita was addressed here, because I think it has some merit. Still an enjoyable book, especially interactions with the Advisory, but I hope that the next one will be more like High Wizardry or at least the first two in the series.
