Well, well, well.

All I had read by Dick before was Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (which was weird in a good way) - and this book was certainly similar, only more on drugs. All kinds of drugs! I liked that it was emotional (although overly so for my tastes), that the characters had depth, and the story was cool. But everything seemed to be written on drugs. Seriously. Not sure what was going on there.

I enjoyed it, and I'll try Man in the High Castle, too, but I won't re-read it and Dick won't be one of my favourite authors, I think.
