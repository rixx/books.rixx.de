So, thriller is most definitely not my genre, but I can't deny that Stephen King is a master - both in his genre and with words in general. He paints incredibly vivid people, murdering for reasons they think right, and dealing with the consequences.

While I'm still not into thrillers, I can't deny the pull these stories have, and I'm sure I'll try a full-length King novel in the future.
