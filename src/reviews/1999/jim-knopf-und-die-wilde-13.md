The second part of the [Jim Button series](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/1999/jim-knopf-und-lukas-der-lokomotivfuhrer)
is still super imaginary, and this time concerns rebuilding (well, expanding, really). It's fun, but lacks the deep
strength of the first part. Also, finding out that Jim is a descendant of one of the Three Kings is kind of random and
when I re-read the book, I was confused and suspicious about Ende's motivation.

But also, this book features a lot of screen time (so to speak) for Molly, the **baby locomotive**, who is just adorable
beyond words.

## Further Reading

For more light-hearted but inconsequential childhood fun like this, [The Night of
Wishes](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2002/the-night-of-wishes) should be a good fit.
