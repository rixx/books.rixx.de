I re-read "Shards of Honour" somewhat by accident while looking up a quote for [a writing
exercise](https://ramble.rixx.de/2020/07/07/tests-and-gifts.html). I had remembered it as a decent first entry in
brilliant series: Okay sci-fi, but nothing special.

Hoo boy. Re-reading this book showed me just how wrong I was. This book is an excellent example of what sci-fi space
romance can look like. I'm not sure if I was in a better frame of mind when re-reading it, or if the knowledge of the
older versions of Cordelia and Aral helped, but here's how much I was into the book: My tooling converts books to text
files and opens them in vim, a plain text editor, so that I can copy and paste the quotes into my blog posts, *and I
read the entire book in my text editor.
