  tldr: I didn't finish this book. Extreme tech pessimism ("kids these days don't
    talk to each other" basically) is not something I'm ever in the mood for.

DNF: The writing style was grating for me, and the book opened with such strong tech pessimism ("kids these days don't know how to talk to each other", phrased a bit more nicely) that I disengaged very soon. Later she goes on to say that she only objects to *commercial* social networks, and that she's sure that decentralised communal ones are perfectly nice, but she had already lost me.
