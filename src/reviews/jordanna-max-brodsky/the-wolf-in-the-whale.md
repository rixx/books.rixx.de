The Wolf in the Whale is delightful fantasy, centered around a small group of Inuit during the phase of christianisation of the vikings. *Jordanna Max Brodsky*, the author, is a dedicated historian, and it shows â€“ the book is never dry or boring, but the amount of research makes for a very solid base on which the book builds wonderfully (for the nerds, there are appendices that are highly interesting, too!)

The book explores gender roles in different societies (and fluidity of gender, etc), the roles of religion and tradition, cross-cultural interaction, personal growth when clashing with one's society. But it also is about magic wolves, Inuit and viking gods, war, and surviving the cold, and so much more. I enjoyed this book a lot.
