The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue by *Mackenzi Lee* is fun, but not outstanding. I was very tolerant of its flaws because it's very queer.<br />The protagonist is an English aristocratic ass on his Grand Tour, which is a fine narrative device … until it gets tiring. Even a mistreated entitled idiot is still an entitled idiot, who in this case is surrounded by way cooler people. Especially his sister, who was the most competent person involved, would've made the book much better if it had been multi-POV, I think. Also, a bit less of a euphoric "we ride into the sunset" ending – I had been hoping against hope for a better ending, and was a bit disgruntled at this.<br /><br />(Goodreads ate my first review, so this is the short and annoyed of it).
