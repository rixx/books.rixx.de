I read **Off Planet** by *Aileen Erin* as an advance reading copy provided by NetGalley. As dystopian scifi goes, it was pretty jumbled and disappointing. We get evil megacorp humans and sensitive aliens, a fighter girl on the run, okay world-building, stupidly emotional people, and horrible dialogue. The story arc is predictable, the writing mediocre, and the characters unconvincing. It's just very middling scifi â€“ not bad enough to make me stop reading half-way through, but that's pretty much all I can say for it.
