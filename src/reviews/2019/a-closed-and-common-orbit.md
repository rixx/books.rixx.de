A Closed and Common Orbit by *Becky Chambers* is the second part of the **Wayfarers** series. It's a good match for the first part: expanding different parts of the world, and worldbuilding, and starring characters that were not quite central to the first book. It delves into the pan-alien world and implications of sentient AI with a sense of wonder, and it's well-written, certainly. It's also … fluff, to use a fanfiction term. It's very much giving us a slice-of-life view of the world, with few to none real confrontations. It can be very calming and healing to see a world where most people just try to live their lives and be good to each other, but I'm fairly happy that I'm only reading this sort of book very occasionally, as I was kind of missing any kind of tension or overarching … thing. But as a once-in-a-while relaxation read, it performs very well.
