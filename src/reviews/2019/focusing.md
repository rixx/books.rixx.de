Focusing by *Eugene T. Gendlin* was my first book I really wanted to give up on this year. I'm always very hesitant to
pick up non-fiction books, especially those that touch on self-help or psychology in any way. There's so much
misinformation and only mildly informed, untested theory out there, and I'm just not qualified to judge what is good and
what isn't. An unqualified reader such as myself is likely to be taken in by somebody with more writing skill than
knowledge, and I really can do without that sort of thing.

**Focusing** was recommended to me, but it starts out trying to sell me things. It tries to sell its own brilliance
("couldn't do without it!"), and innovation ("studying some questions that most psychotherapists don't like to ask out
loud"), and services (repeated mentions of telephone advice services available). If your book tries to sell me on its
brilliance and related services without even presenting its case first, I feel like the door-to-door salesman just rung
to sell me a washing machine that I don't need. The writing is always either selling or talking down to the reader and I
found it very offputting – I don't like the cheap manipulation that comes with this style of writing.

The core idea is listening to your body, and experiencing bodily shifts (positive feelings of a knot opening etc) when
trying to figure out a problem – basically a meditative practice. This is very plausible to me, but the writing made it
hard to get through the material. So, spoilers, here is their methodology:

1. **Calm down**: Sit down, calm down, breathe for a bit. Then list the things that feel like they're currently a
   problem for you.
2. Choose the problem you want to work on. Keep an emotional distance and instead figure out how your body feels when
   concentrating on that problem (this will be uncomfortable). Disregard your inner monologue (i.e. analysis, guilt,
   etc.).
3. Focus on finding the word (or maybe a very short phrase) that *exactly* describes your *feeling* regarding the
   problem. You'll notice when you hit on the right one, because your feeling will change (usually ease). This will take
   a while.
4. Compare the word/image you found in the last step and compare them with the feeling you found and defined in the
   second step. Make sure they match (i.e. trigger a shift in feeling), otherwise repeat 3. Pay attention to how your
   feeling shifts now that you have a good name for them.
5. Trigger a clearer understanding by focussing on the name you found and concentrating on some questions, like "What
   about this problem makes me ____?", or "What's the worst/most ____ about this?", or "What would it take for this to
   feel ok?". *Wait* for the answer to bubble up, don't trust fast answers (which are probably just preconceived notions
   of how your mind *should* work.)
6. Accept the answers you find, without judgement. You can always decide to disagree with them later, but you have to
   accept them without judgement first.

The first step is a bit like unfocused meditation, maybe even metta meditation. I liked the question "How would my body
feel if this problem was somehow solved?" as an entrypoint to exploring a problem. The other steps are more focused
meditation, and all involve being calm, slightly distanced, and taking some time (at least half a minute or a minute) of
waiting for answers to show up. Not terribly exciting, and worse for the fact that it sees itself as more of a therapy
approach as opposed to a meditation thing.

## Further Reading

If you're less into verbal approaches and more into visualisation, [Feeding Your
Demons](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2020/feeding-your-demons-ancient-wisdom-for-resolving-inner-conflict/) does
something very similar to Focusing
