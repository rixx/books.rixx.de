Ever wanted to read a self-aware Expendables in a Fantasy world? **Kings of the Wyld** by *Nicholas Eames* is for you. I wasn't a fan for the first half (it was solid, but kinda annoying, and Getting The Band Back Together isn't my kind of story), but it shaped up massively in the second half, and I really enjoyed the ending!<br />The first half of the book does a lot of work to establish the characters and the humor, and took its sweet time about it. It seemed as if the book was only ha-ha-funny, but the second half tugged on some serious heartstrings, and found a good compromise between humour and serious character building/experiences.
