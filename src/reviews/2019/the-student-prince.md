The Student Prince is very well-written Merlin (the TV show) fanfiction. You don't need to know the show to enjoy it: It transplants the characters of Merlin, Arthur, Morgana, Lancelot et al into pre-Brexit UK, where they go to college and deal with school and magic. Also national security. Also LGBT issues. I liked it a lot. It's available at [AO3](<a target="_blank" href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/23355" rel="nofollow">https://archiveofourown.org/series/23355</a>).
