While **Beneath the Sugar Sky** by *Seanan McGuire* was yet another pleasant entry in the *Wayward Children* series, it didn't grab me nearly as much as the previous novellas. Maybe it's just that I'm not into Candyland, or that of the troupe of children on the rescue mission I only really liked half (and felt for those two or three). The whole story just felt a bit flat, and I felt that the main character was more told than shown, and due to this and her tendency to inaction, she felt rather pale.
