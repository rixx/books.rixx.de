Even though I'm a fan of sentient ships: [The Last Voyage or Skidbladnir](<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tor.com/2019/01/14/karin-tidbeck-the-last-voyage-of-skidbladnir/" rel="nofollow">https://www.tor.com/2019/01/14/karin-...</a>) is just an okay scifi short story â€“ too predictable for my tastes, and the switch between concrete scenes and dream-like time skips feel unfinished. But the concept of sentient space ships is always a nice one.
