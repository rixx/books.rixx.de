The Final Empire is good Fantasy, no more, no less. In comparison with Sanderson's Stormlight Archives it feels much more YA-y (not in a bad way, though). I enjoyed that I wasn't able to predict the plot too far ahead, aside of generalities. This book didn't shake my perception of the world â€“ it's too generic for that, but it's genuinely touching in enough places to keep it from feeling boring/overly generic/as if I had read it already.
