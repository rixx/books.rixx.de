This book has got a couple of good things to say (be playful, be prolific, facilitate accidents and clashes), and tells a bunch of really neat anecdotes of past inventions and big ideas. I don't really think the anecdotes are good arguments for any of the points the book makes, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. As a whole, it's not terribly deep, and for some reason that I can't put my finger on, reading it felt very tedious.
