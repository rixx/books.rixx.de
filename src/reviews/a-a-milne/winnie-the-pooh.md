This book is, of course, adorable in every way. The dorky bear with his friends in various stages being excitable,
exuberant, worried, forgetful, depressed, busy, or superior are delightful and a neat way to keep a child entertained.

But clearly the best version of this book is the Latin version by Alexander Lenard (or at home: Lénárd Sándor). It
follows the patterns and phrases of classical Latin to very comedic effect, and is probably best given to students in or
past their fifth year of Latin.

It's always nice to be reminded that the nerds have always been out there.

## Fun Facts

[Apparently](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/18/books/winnie-ille-pu-nearly-xxv-years-later.html), Lenard had a
long-standing correspondence with Robert Grave in Latin – in character for both of them! For more of Robert Graves, see
[I, Claudius](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2020/i-claudius).

## Further Reading

If you enjoy this, you're probably a nerd for classical education and allusions, so you should absolutely go and read
[Gaudy Night](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2020/gaudy-night/).
