  tldr: The Gavroche story extracted from Les Misérables. Nice read, as much as Hugo can ever be nice.

Heavily edited short excerpt from Les Mis. The most enjoyable part was the short Hugo bio after the main part, which was
extremely biased – the edition is from Eastern Germany after all.

Took me back to my childhood. I actually enjoy that there are standalone excerpts like this, because Les Mis is so
daunting and long to read. It's an early form of remixing, I'd say, and I'd love to see more of it.
