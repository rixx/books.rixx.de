  tldr: At some point, Dorothy Sayers figured out that her forte was characters and
    dialogue, not plot, and this book delivers. It's a honeymoon with a murder, and
    who even cares about plot beyond that.

I think at this point (maybe earlier, but who knows) Dorothy Sayers had understood that her forte was in the characters and the dialogue, and WOW does she ever deliver. It's a honeymoon with a murder, of course, and I can't get over my love of the characters, so I won't even try.

As always, interesting to see how society worked back then. Commentary on everywhere sexism is very intentional, while the Scot and the Jew collecting money are, ahem, less reflected.
