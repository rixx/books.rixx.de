  tldr: Fun, well-written Fantasy with strong characters and actual development. A
    bit predictable, but the setting and writing make up for it.

Fun, well-written Fantasy with very strong characters and great character development. Bit predictable, and a
fairly large cast, but still a good read – and that's saying something for a novel that may be Fantasy, but has not the
least bit adventure in it, instead going for ALL the politics.

What I liked best about this book is how everybody in there is a *person*. Not necessarily a good person, oh no! But
there are good people, and there are people who try to be good, and people who occasionally try to be good but
mostly try to be powerful – but they are all very much themselves and you won't get them confused with each other even
if the names don't stick.
