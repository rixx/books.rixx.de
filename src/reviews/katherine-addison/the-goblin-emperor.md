  tldr: Fun, well-written Fantasy with strong characters and actual development. A
    bit predictable maybe, but the setting and writing make up for it.

Fun, well-written Fantasy with very strong characters and great character development. Bit predictable, maybe, and a fairly large cast, but still a good read.
