This story has potential, but rationalists and their aversion to humour kind of ruins it. [The Last Christmas](<a target="_blank" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas" rel="nofollow">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/...</a>) is a fun premise, but way too short to build it up properly, and so it ends up all over the place. Still: It's pretty short, and a nice read, so if you want to see how an engineer deals with suddenly being Santa, go check it out.
