Often, I'm a reader of simple tastes. This is a drabble, a writing exercise, 320 pages long, that cheerfully tears into
bad TV show scifi. It enjoys itself, it spends most of its time not punching down. It's not high art, it's not deep,
it's just straight-up fun â€“ if you're into the meta underpinnings. Otherwise, it's probably 300 pages of tedious jokes.
It made me laugh, a lot.
