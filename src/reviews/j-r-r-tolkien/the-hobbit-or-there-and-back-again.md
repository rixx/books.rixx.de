  text: Hope Mirrlees managed the same impression of proper British middle-class frowning upon their own involvement with the fantastic, and eleven years ahead of Tolkien at that.
- book: neil-gaiman/stardust
  text: Stardust has the same well-written, well-considered feeling of fantasy that doesn't take itself too seriously.

  text: For more of this gently exploratory feeling, The Neverending Story works, provided you don't have a problem with thinly veiled moral lessons.

The hobbit was my first Tolkien. I read it first when I was eight, but I had already listened to the excellent audio
book about a million times – I got that for my fifth or sixth birthday. It introduced me to so many concepts.

There could be tongue-in-cheek humour hiding in plain sight! In a book! Foreshadowing was a thing! You could just
include *songs and poems*, wow. All of these were a revelation to me at the time, and I still treasure the feeling of
following Bilbo, and being terribly invested and at the same time being certain that I was missing something, that
something went over my head. Naturally, I resolved to find out what it was. I remember asking adults around me for a lot
of explanations for small oddities, especially around the behaviour of Bilbo and the dwarves – they are way more funny
if you're know about the cultural norms being broken, and Bilbo's caricature of a proper English posh guy, and I had to
pick up a lot of pieces to get there.

I'm pretty sure that unless you're a die-hard fan of old epics, the Hobbit is vastly better than the Lord of the Rings.
It's not as drawn-out, the characters are more than stereotypes, there's actual humour, and it's just super rewarding to
read.
