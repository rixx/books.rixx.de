I don't have many memories of the third Sams book. I think I had more pity for Martin than for his father, because kids
being bullied was relatable, whereas adults who were bullied looked weird and even contemptuous to me. But at the same
time, I think both Martin and his father were self-inserts, and Paul Maar just is a better adult than kid. Or maybe he
just had forgotten about being a kid.

## Further Reading

For a superpowered nerd kid, read
[HPMOR](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2014/harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality) if you can stand the smugness,
or any other litrpg. [The Neverending Story](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2002/the-neverending-story) also fits the
bill.
