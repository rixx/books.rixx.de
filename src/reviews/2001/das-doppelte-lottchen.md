Das doppelte Lottchen (English: Lottie and Lisa) is exactly what I loved to read as a child. The story of the twins
Liese and Lotte, who were split up soon after birth when their parents separated. Once the two very different girls
realise they are twins at a summer camp, they decide to switch places.

It's like a modern fairytale. K채stner takes elements of modern life, like parents separating, and weaves them into
fairytale elements with secret twins, children's deception and anguish and joy.

As always, K채stner has a not-so-secret agenda, but in this case it is the least obnoxious, the most human. Also the only
one without a transparent self-insert. This book feels deeply like childhood to me, and I like it a lot.

## Further Reading

Of K채stner's novels, [The Flying Classroom](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2001/das-fliegende-klassenzimmer) feels very
similar to this one, as does [Emil](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2004/emil-and-the-detectives). Of other books, the
[Jim Button](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/1999/jim-knopf-und-lukas-der-lokomotivfuhrer) series comes close in the way
it shows the world from the perspective of children. For slightly older children, the [Young
Wizards](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2016/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard) also shows children struggling with the real
world in a good way.
