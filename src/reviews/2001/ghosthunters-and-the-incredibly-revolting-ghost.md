I have a vaguely positive memory of this book, but that's about it. The protagonist was nice, had an annoying older
sister, and dealt with ghosts with cleverness and hacked up techy devices? It's basically the Cornelia Funke boy series
to her more famous [girl series](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2004/die-wilden-huhner).
