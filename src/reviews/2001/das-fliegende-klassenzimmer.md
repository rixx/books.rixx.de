It's the one German boarding school novel and I loved it to pieces as a kid. As all Kästner books except for
[Lottchen](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2001/das-doppelte-lottchen) it features a fairly transparent self-insert, but
it's fine, imo. Most boarding school novels do this, to be honest.

What I appreciate most, I think, is how real it feels. The kids have worries and problems, and they are vital and real
and are never minimised. No matter if one of the boys feels scared and neglected or if one has not enough money to go
home for Christmas: they have existential feelings and the book does not shy away from them. There are good teachers and
stern teachers, older bullies, younger bullies, protectors in unlikely places, artsy students, and above all:
friendship.

There are a couple of passages in this book that touched my life, repeatedly, when they showed adults behaving with
responsibility and kindness when I felt that I had nobody who I could count on to do the same for me. I first read this
book when I was nine, and then read it many more times until I was ~13. I'm hardly objective here, but it feels like
home and I love it.

## Further Reading

For younger kids, the [Jim Button](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/1999/jim-knopf-und-lukas-der-lokomotivfuhrer) have a
similar feeling. I'm not sure I know any books for adults that have a similar vibe of "life is hard but everything is
going to be alright". Technically, the [Tiffany Aching](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2010/the-wee-free-men) fit the
bill, but they're more "life is hard and everything miiiight be alright, if you put in a lot of work". Which is true,
but not the same.
