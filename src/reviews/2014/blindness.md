Blindness felt really strong – the general vibe of the book is still easy to recall for me years later. The epidemic
blindness that befalls everybdoy in contact with a victim is terrifying, but the terror isn't overdone. It's humanized,
low-key, loving even. I'm glad I read this book.

## Further Reading

A book that's often paired due to a similar theme and feeling is [The
Plague](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2010/the-plague) – though I prefer Blindness, to be honest.
