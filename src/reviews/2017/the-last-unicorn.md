I really enjoyed this one - it's a fairytale, it's very very lyrical, but at the same time it surprises you with bursts of dry humour. The length and pacing is perfect, too - it's a fairly short book, but it carries its length well.

## Further Reading

[Stardust](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2013/stardust) is similar romantic-realistic Fantasy, though it follows of a
more conventional arc. If you liked the lyrical language and the brutal humour, and don't mind reading a bit of sci-fi,
[This is how you lose the time war](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2019/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war) would be a
good fit.
