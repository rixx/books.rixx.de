  tldr: Not what I expected – it's focused on "communities" for corporate entities.
    Contains impressive collection of examples, but only positive ones, so yay for
    survivor bias.

This is an alright book if you want to build a "community" for a corporate entity. It tries to provide more than that, but everything it suggests feels just slightly icky and tainted with this corporate language. But it does provide actionable advice, and a solid focus on engagement and growth.

It also presents an impressive collection of well-researched current examples for communities like Twitch. Sadly, no failures are examined, so the survivorship bias is strong here.

For an advice collection geared towards corporate and marketing cultures, it completely skips over money, employment, and compensation. This is definitely a difficult and contentious topic when building a community around a product, so I'm surprised this was left out.

Side note: there is no groundwork, no theory to stand on, which would have interested me a lot.
