I can't write a good review for this book, because it was clear that I was in the wrong headspace for it. Banks
describes a modern-day cult from the inside perspective of the potential next leader, a devoted young woman. She has a
strong voice, strong opinions, and the narration mirrors her perspective beautifully. I suspect this book can be fairly
enjoyable, but to me it felt only depressing.

For fictional religions, I prefer [Cat's Cradle](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2020/cats-cradle) which felt less
depressing somehow, even though it's literally about the end of the world.
