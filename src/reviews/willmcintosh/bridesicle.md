Good title. Sadly, [Bridesicle](<a target="_blank" href="http://will.tip.dhappy.org/blog/Profit-Donation%20Funding/.../book/by/Will%20McIntosh/Bridesicle/Will%20McIntosh%20-%20Bridesicle.html" rel="nofollow">http://will.tip.dhappy.org/blog/Profi...</a>) by *Will McIntosh* is not as good as its title â€“ cryo facilities where people can be revived by prospective partners. He tries to capture the horror of it all, but it fell flat for me.
