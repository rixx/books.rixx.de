This book has good, true sentences. It also has weird stretches. It reads like a time capsule into late 70s/early 80s feminism, so I was surprised at the 1999 release date. I liked it for the respectful discussion of agency and how both men and women suffer from oppressive structures and structural terribleness. At the same time there were things that I didn't agree with, and I did some heavy skipping around the Jesus parts (I'm not a Jesus person).
