This is comfort food, but it's GOOD comfort food. Fantasy world with inverted gender roles (only one man per 20 women, group family marriages ensue). It follows the Regency romance arc perfectly except for leaving out that relationship building part in the second third, which actually might've been better to include. But it's really enjoyable â€“ takes the gender role reversal seriously, isn't stupid about it, but also clearly just has a lot of fun telling the story.
