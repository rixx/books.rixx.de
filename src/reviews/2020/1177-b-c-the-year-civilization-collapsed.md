This book was a great overview of the wider mediterranean civilisations during the Bronze Age, with a short discussion
of the so-called collapse towards the end. I went into it expecting a lot of content about the collapse itself, and the
book turned out to be 80% stage-setting. I happen to like this sort of thing, so it was a pleasant surprise, but
depending on your tastes, this could also be less fun.

An interesting point is that reading this book in pre-internet times would have been absolute torture for me. In the
interest of being a comprehensive introduction for interested people, the book mentions a lot of fascinating events,
people, and places in passing. I spent at least as much time following references as I spent reading the book, or even
more. Imagine having to wait and go to the library and try to make sense of it all instead!

It's not an action-packed or even fast-paced book, but if you're interested in early history, give it a go.
