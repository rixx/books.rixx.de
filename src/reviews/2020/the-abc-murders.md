Another Poirot mystery. I liked how self-aware Christie is in this book â€“ Poirot routinely mocks (gently, even!) mystery
stereotypes in hilarious ways. Hastings as a narrator continues to be stupid in an intentionally pompous, upper-class
way, which is tedious if you read too much of it. The case in itself is not terrible, but nothing great either.
