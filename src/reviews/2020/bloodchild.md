I first read Bloodchild last year, I think, and re-read it now. It's a very Octavia Butler story â€“ aliens cohabitating with humans and making ties that touch on reproductive and life cycles is kinda a thing she does? But she does it well, and it's not a repeated shtick. I didn't *enjoy* the story as such, but it was expertly written, and viscerally stuck in my memory. (Also: ew.)
