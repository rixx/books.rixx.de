This was a fair Wimsey novel â€“ banter (especially between Him and Her), with the mystery being less important than the people. The strong focus on their non-relationship detracted a bit from my carefree enjoyment, though, and made me read the book more through a historian's lense: Gender roles, social norms, and general expectations have changed *so much*, and Dorothy L. Sayers' take on them is fascinating and utterly foreign to me.
