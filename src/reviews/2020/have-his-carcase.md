  tldr: I went on a bit of a mystery streak here. This one is mostly character building
    for Peter and Harriet and their interactions. Good to read through a historian's
    lens, because holy gender role batman.

This was a fair Wimsey novel â€“ banter (especially between Him and Her), with the mystery being less important than the people. The strong focus on their non-relationship detracted a bit from my carefree enjoyment, though, and made me read the book more through a historian's lense: Gender roles, social norms, and general expectations have changed *so much*, and Dorothy L. Sayers' take on them is fascinating and utterly foreign to me.
