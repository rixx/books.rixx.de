Good example of science writing that is useful and accessible without dumbing things down beyond reason. I learnt some things and was surprised how much Ian Deary managed to fit into the slim book.

Among the things I learnt was how terrifying age-related decline is, but also the fascinating studies on how little upbringing seems to influence intelligence.
