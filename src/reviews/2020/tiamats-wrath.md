  tldr: Another easy 5/5 rating. There's no way I can describe this book without spoilers,
    so I'll just say that despite all odds and fears, the Expanse series just keeps
    improving.

I don't think I could review this book without spoilers, but it wowed me, and angered me, and is generally VERY VERY good.
