I think at this point (maybe earlier, but who knows) Dorothy Sayers had understood that her forte was in the characters and the dialogue, and WOW does she ever deliver. It's a honeymoon with a murder, of course, and I can't get over my love of the characters, so I won't even try.

As always, interesting to see how society worked back then. Commentary on everywhere sexism is very intentional, while the Scot and the Jew collecting money are, ahem, less reflected.
