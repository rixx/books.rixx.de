I strongly disliked many parts of this book. The writing is obnoxious, self-righteous, pseudo-Socratic without ever coming close. I fundamentally disagree with a lot of its premises, and it's in many ways /r/wowthanksimhealed material. This book is very punchable.

At the same time it has been extremely useful to me, in an immediate and actionable way, and I'm very glad I've read it. Books that changed my life get five stars on here, and it undeniably did that.

I only found this thread on Twitter afterwards, and it contains pretty much all of the book without the obnoxiousness: <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1037715339314847747" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1...</a>
