The God Engines is a fantasy-in-space novella that involves space ships powered by imprisoned gods.

What are you still here for? I liked this one a lot, but it's also slotting into my interests as if it was written for
me – my book site has a [Space Monks](https://books.rixx.de/lists/space-monks/) list for a reason. It's not [Small
Gods](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2005/small-gods/), but it follows the same general principles on godhood and how
belief powers gods, only that those gods then power space ships.

What stood out to me was that while the general storyline might be a bit predictable, the ending was *not*, and the
characters felt nuanced and real and like Scalzi took them serious. No lazy writing here. I don't regret spending an
evening on this at all. The length felt good, too – turning it into a full-length novel would be possible, and for
Scalzi probably not even hard, but it would make the story much more tedious. This length keeps everything moving along
nicely without feeling rushed.
