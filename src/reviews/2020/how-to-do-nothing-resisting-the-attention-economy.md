DNF: The writing style was grating for me, and the book opened with such strong tech pessimism ("kids these days don't know how to talk to each other", phrased a bit more nicely) that I disengaged very soon. Later she goes on to say that she only objects to *commercial* social networks, and that she's sure that decentralised communal ones are perfectly nice, but she had already lost me.
