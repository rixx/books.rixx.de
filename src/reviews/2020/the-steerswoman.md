Gooood Fantasy! Highly likable characters, good world, good plot, excellent eye for detail. The concept of a mostly-female order/guild/group of scientifically minded truth seekers is very cool, and yet not overdone. Feels like Science Fantasy in a NK Jemisin way. Way to go on the emancipation side: women being equal to men is just a non-issue in all jobs (guards, merchants, sailors, etc).

If I had read this a couple of years ago, I might have been less susceptible to HPMOR.
