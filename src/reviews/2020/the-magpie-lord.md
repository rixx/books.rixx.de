Romance, mysterious curse, estate management: A queer/gay romance in a fantasy version of Victorian England.  The
youngest exiled son of a lord returns to England after his father and brother die, and has to contest with the curse
that led to their deaths. Luckily, he finds a strange but attractive young wizard blah blah blah, you see where this
ends.  Very atmospheric, and a bit too well-written to deserve to be labeled as "enjoyable trash".

What's up with the 1800s queer romances? The [Montague
Siblings])(https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2019/the-gentlemans-guide-to-vice-and-virtue) goes down a very similar road,
not that I'm complaining. There's a second part, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to read it.
