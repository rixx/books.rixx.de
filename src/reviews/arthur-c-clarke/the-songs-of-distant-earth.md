  tldr: A calm, optimistic story of the last humans leaving Earth, visiting another
    human settlement. Infuriatingly it left out everything I wanted to hear more about,
    and was lovely nevertheless.

A future human settlement gets visited by the last travellers from the doomed planet earth, on their way to their final
destination, a new earth. Very calm, slow, slightly utopian.

I'm not really sure what to make of this book. On the one hand, it was utterly lovely: The calm, nearly slice-of-life story of the surviving members of the human race. Touching, simple, optimistic, â€¦ sweet? At the same time, the lack of tension made me take a long time reading this book, and the parts that were interesting to me (the other planet! the ALIEN LIFE!) were only mentioned in passing. Weirdly frustrating for such a nice and optimistic book.
