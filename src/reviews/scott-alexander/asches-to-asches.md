What is truth, quoth Pontius Pilate. [Asches to Asches](<a target="_blank" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/03/asches-to-asches/" rel="nofollow">https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/03...</a>) is one of those witty stories by *Scott Alexander*. It illustrates **precisely** the source of my anxiety when reading non-fiction: I think I can be conned into believing anything if you just dress it up correctly. Good read, good ending.
