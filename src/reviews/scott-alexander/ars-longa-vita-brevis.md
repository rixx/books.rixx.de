What is it with rationalist fiction and that stilted style? Can't people make an argument without sounding like badly written robot hybrids?
[Ars Longa, Vita Brevis](<a target="_blank" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/09/ars-longa-vita-brevis/" rel="nofollow">https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/09...</a>) is not one of *Scott Alexander*'s best stories. Skippable, to me, because the content lost out against the style.
