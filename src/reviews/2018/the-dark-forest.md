I felt both bored and annoyed at **The Dark Forest** (sequel to *Liu Cixin*'s **The Three Body Problem**). The plot was convoluted and wandering, but not all that bad – but the people in it continued to be cardboard cutouts of *one* motivation, and maybe one emotion or one habit, if you were lucky. Also, the vanishingly few female characters had even less of a personality (and were mostly partners-of-somebody with little page time and even less impact). One female character was literally introduced directly as the protagonist's fantasy and then fridged to provide motivation for him.<br /><br />The exploration of future development of humanity was the thing I enjoyed most, I think. Other than that, most developments and actions felt super random, like they were completely contrived just to further the plot, no matter if they made sense or not. I won't continue with this series.
