This book gives a good overview over the way online culture gravitates towards outrage and shaming. We get to meet some of the people impacted by this, and industries surrounding it, as well as contextualisation, both historical and with the justice system. While there is little actionable advice here â€“ I appreciated it. It read like a very long, thorough reportage and I enjoyed reading it.
