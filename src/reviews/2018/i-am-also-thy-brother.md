This was a really rewarding (and terribly long) series. I liked the constant self-improvement and evolution the characters had. Even if the plot was predictable at times, and people didn't change much beyond their morality, I liked it, since they evolved in their understanding and behaviour. I even think I learned some things about myself, and have come to think of other things about myself differently â€“ and what more can you ask of any book?
