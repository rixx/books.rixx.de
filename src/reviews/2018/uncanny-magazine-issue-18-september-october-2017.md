Two reviews for this issue: [Fandom for Robots](<a target="_blank" href="https://uncannymagazine.com/article/fandom-for-robots/" rel="nofollow">https://uncannymagazine.com/article/f...</a>) is a charming humorous story about the only existing sentient robot (bulky out-of-date thing from the 50s) finds anime and fanfiction. Fluffy, funny, but sadly a bit inconsequential.



[Clearly Lettered in a Mostly Steady Hand](<a target="_blank" href="https://uncannymagazine.com/article/clearly-lettered-mostly-steady-hand/" rel="nofollow">https://uncannymagazine.com/article/c...</a>) is a short story that has garnered a lot of award nominations. It wasn't to my taste at all, but if you enjoy horror and weirdness (imagine a horror short story somebody wanted to sound like Neil Gaiman), this is a very short read that may be for you.
