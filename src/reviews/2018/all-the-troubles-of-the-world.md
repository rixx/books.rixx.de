This short story by *Isaac Asimov*, available [online](<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mcguiremarks.com/uploads/3/9/7/9/39793909/isaac_asimov-all_the_troubles_of_the_world_(1).pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcguiremarks.com/uploads/3...</a>) was heart-breaking and well-paced. I was kind of sick of reading of dystopic futures with evil, flawed humans and evil, flawed AI everywhere, and this story is a nice break from all that.
