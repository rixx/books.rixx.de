Waiting for Godot showed me how free literature was, and the things a determined author can do with and through (and
arguably to) a group of actors. I like it for this learning impact, a lot.

## Further Reading

If you can stand him, the logical next step would be Kafka, both his
[Trial](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2008/the-trial) and [Castle](https://books.de/reviews/2009/the-castle).

If you'd rather not go deeper into bleakness, consider turning towards trippy books and starting with [Alice in
Wonderland](https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2004/alice-in-wonderland).
