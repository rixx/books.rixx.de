Patternmaster was very enjoyable, and presented great characters (ever *Octavia Butler*'s strength). There was decent worldbuilding, and I'd love to learn more about this world that is a distant decendant of ours â€“ but sadly, the book ends way too early, at a point where I felt there hadn't been all that much plot yet.
