Do you like some heavy-handed xenophobia morals in your scifi? [The Kite Maker](<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tor.com/2018/08/29/the-kite-maker-brenda-peynado/" rel="nofollow">https://www.tor.com/2018/08/29/the-ki...</a>) is a short story playing on Earth, 15 years after a peaceful alien race arrived. The Dragonflies, as they were called, were greeted with violence, and now that they are somewhat integrated into society, the right mob moves against them. Heavy-handed metaphore is mixed with good characterization, leading to an intentionally painful, okay-but-not-quite-good short story.
