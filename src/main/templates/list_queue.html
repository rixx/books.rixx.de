  <h2>Book queue</h2>

  <p>These books are currently in my active reading queue, that is, they are on my reader and waiting for me to get around to them.</p>

  <p>
    There are {{ total_books }} books here in total, with {{ total_pages }} pages.
    Going off last year, where I read {{ past_year_books }} books ({{ past_year_pages }} pages),
    it will take me just about {{ factor_books }} years to get through these
    (or, more precisely going by pages, {{ factor_pages }} years).
  </p>

  <p>â€¦ if I don't add any new books in the meantime.</p>

  {% for shelf in shelves %}
  <h3>{{ shelf.name }}</h3>

    <summary>Show all {{ shelf.books.count() }} books ({{ shelf.page_count }} pages)</summary>
