# books.rixx.de

This is the source code for <https://books.rixx.de>, where I track the books I've read, and that I want to read.
This repo contains both the scripts that build the site, and the source data used by the scripts.

## How it works

Each book is a text file, with a bit of metadata at the top, and Markdown text in the body. When I run the build script,
it reads all these files, and turns them into a set of HTML files. I upload a copy of those HTML files to my web server,
where they're served by nginx.

The data entry is eased by a data entry script that allows me to add books to any of the three piles, and can also pull
(book) data from Goodreads or push data (my reading state) to Goodreads. But this repo and its contents are the primary
data source.

## Usage

In a virtualenv, run `pip install -e .`. Then you can run:

- `books auth` to get and save your Goodreads credentials
- `books add` (or `books new` because I can never remember which one it is, so both work) to add a new book, either
  from Goodreads or with manual data input
- `books edit` opens an interactive menu allowing you to choose a book and change either some or all of the data, move
  it to a different state, retrieve a cover image from goodreads/google/openlibrary/a link of your choice, and sync all
  changes back to Goodreads if you choose.
  pull data from Goodreads, or push data to Goodreads.
- `books build` to build the site
- `books load` to bulk-import book data from a database in the format created by
  [goodreads-to-sqlite](https://github.com/rixx/goodreads-to-sqlite)
